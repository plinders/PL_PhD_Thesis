  abstract = {Clinical glycomics comprises a spectrum of different analytical methodologies to analyze glycan structures, which provides insights into the mechanisms of glycosylation. Within clinical diagnostics, glycomics serves as a functional readout of genetic variants, and can form a basis for therapy development, as was described for PGM1-CDG. Integration of glycomics with genomics has resulted in the elucidation of previously unknown disorders of glycosylation, namely CCDC115-CDG, TMEM199-CDG, ATP6AP1-CDG, MAN1B1-CDG, and PGM1-CDG. This review provides an introduction into protein glycosylation and presents the different glycomics methodologies ranging from gel electrophoresis to mass spectrometry (MS) and from free glycans to intact glycoproteins. The role of glycomics in the diagnosis of congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) is presented, including a diagnostic flow chart and an overview of glycomics data of known CDG subtypes. The review ends with some future perspectives, showing upcoming technologies as system wide mapping of the N- and O-glycoproteome, intact glycoprotein profiling and analysis of sugar metabolism. These new advances will provide additional insights and opportunities to develop personalized therapy. This is especially true for inborn errors of metabolism, which are amenable to causal therapy, because interventions through supplementation therapy can directly target the pathogenesis at the molecular level.},

  abstract = {Protein synthesis begins at free ribosomes or ribosomes attached with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Newly synthesized proteins are transported to the plasma membrane for secretion through conventional or unconventional pathways. In conventional protein secretion, proteins are transported from the ER lumen to Golgi lumen and through various other compartments to be secreted at the plasma membrane, while unconventional protein secretion bypasses the Golgi apparatus. Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNARE) proteins are involved in cargo vesicle trafficking and membrane fusion. The ER localized vesicle associated SNARE (v-SNARE) protein Sec22 plays a major role during anterograde and retrograde transport by promoting efficient membrane fusion and assisting in the assembly of higher order complexes by homodimer formation. Sec22 is not only confined to ER\&ndash;Golgi intermediate compartments (ERGIC) but also facilitates formation of contact sites between ER and plasma membranes. Sec22 mutation is responsible for the development of atherosclerosis and symptoms in the brain in Alzheimer\&rsquo;s disease and aging in humans. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, Sec22 is essential for photoreceptor morphogenesis, the wingless signaling pathway, and normal ER, Golgi, and endosome morphology. In the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, it is involved in development, and in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, it is in involved in the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway. In filamentous fungi, it affects cell wall integrity, growth, reproduction, pathogenicity, regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), expression of extracellular enzymes, and transcriptional regulation of many development related genes. This review provides a detailed account of Sec22 function, summarizes its domain structure, discusses its genetic redundancy with Ykt6, discusses what is known about its localization to discrete membranes, its contributions in conventional and unconventional autophagy, and a variety of other roles across different cellular systems ranging from higher to lower eukaryotes, and highlights some of the surprises that have originated from research on Sec22.},

Here we report a novel mechanism for sorting of the ER\textendash Golgi Q-SNAREs into COPII vesicles. Different mammalian Sec24 isoforms recruit either the R-SNARE Sec22b or the Q-SNAREs Syntaxin5, GS27, and Bet1. Syntaxin5 is the only Q-SNARE that directly interacts with Sec24C, requiring its ``open'' conformation. Mutation within the IxM cargo-binding site of Sec24C led to a drastic reduction in sorting of all three Q-SNAREs into COPII vesicles, implying their ER export as a preassembled complex. Analysis of immunoisolated COPII vesicles and intracellular localization of Sec24 isoforms indicate that all ER\textendash Golgi SNAREs are present on the same vesicle. Combined with existing data, our findings yield a general concept of how Sec24 isoforms can recruit fusogenic SNARE subunits to keep them functionally apart and thus prime mammalian COPII vesicles for homotypic fusion.},

The enzyme may catalyse the hydrolysis of various monophosphate esters at alkaline pH. The objective of this study was to quantify ALP functioning particularly in the membranes of eukaryotic cells. The membranes of seven different cells (myeloma cells; hybrid cells; erythroleukaemia cells; lymphocytes and erythrocytes) were tested for ALP activity using a cellular enzyme assay, which is based on the conversion of para-nitrophenylphosphate (p-NPP) to para-nitrophenol and the colorimetric determination of the resulting coloured product. The test system was optimised with respect to substrate concentration, reaction time and the number of cells used as a source of enzyme. The obtained values were converted to quantitative results through a standard curve created using commercial ALP. In order to determine the effect of serum concentration on enzyme activity, 1G2 hybridoma, which is among the cells used in this study and which synthesizes monoclonal antibody against human serum albumin, was produced in different serum concentrations ranging from 0 to 15\%.},

In addition, some microscopy techniques such as fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and single-molecule-based techniques are very sensitive to high expression levels of FFPs. To reduce the levels of recombinant protein expression in comparison with the commonly used, very strong CMV promoter, the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (TK) gene promoter, and mutants thereof were analyzed. Deletion mutants of the TK promoter were constructed and introduced into the Gateway\textregistered{} system for ectopic expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP), monomeric cherry (mCherry), and FFPs containing these FPs. Two promoter constructs, TK2ST and TKTSC, were established, which have optimal low expression levels suitable for FCS studies in U2OS, HeLa CCL2, NIH 3T3, and BALB/c cells. Interestingly, when tested in these four cell lines, promoter constructs having a deletion within TK gene 5{${'}$}-UTR showed significantly higher protein expression levels than the equivalent constructs lacking this deletion. This suggests that a negative regulatory element is localized within the TK gene 5{${'}$}-UTR.},

Here, we have used RNA interference against the SNARE proteins syntaxin 5 and syntaxin 16, combined with recently developed quantitative trafficking assays, morphological approaches and cell intoxication analysis to show that these SNARE proteins are not only required for efficient retrograde transport of Shiga toxin, but also for that of an endogenous cargo protein - the mannose 6-phosphate receptor - and for the productive trafficking into cells of cholera toxin and ricin. We have found that the function of syntaxin 16 was specifically required for, and restricted to, the retrograde pathway. Strikingly, syntaxin 5 RNA interference protected cells particularly strongly against Shiga toxin. Since our trafficking analysis showed that apart from inhibiting retrograde endosome-to-TGN transport, the silencing of syntaxin 5 had no additional effect on Shiga toxin endocytosis or trafficking from TGN/Golgi membranes to the endoplasmic reticulum, we hypothesize that syntaxin 5 also has trafficking-independent functions. In summary, our data demonstrate that several cellular and exogenous cargo proteins use elements of the same SNARE machinery for efficient retrograde transport between early/recycling endosomes and TGN/Golgi membranes.},

Affinity-purified antibodies that block the ability of endobrevin/VAMP-8 to form SNARE core complexes potently inhibit homotypic fusion of both early and late endosomes in vitro. Fab fragments were as active as intact immunoglobulin Gs. Recombinant endobrevin/VAMP-8 inhibited both fusion reactions with similar potency.

We performed more than 175 edits in human cells, including targeted insertions, deletions, and all 12 types of point mutation, without requiring double-strand breaks or donor DNA templates. We used prime editing in human cells to correct, efficiently and with few byproducts, the primary genetic causes of sickle cell disease (requiring a transversion in HBB) and Tay-Sachs disease (requiring a deletion in HEXA); to install a protective transversion in PRNP; and to insert various tags and epitopes precisely into target loci. Four human cell lines and primary post-mitotic mouse cortical neurons support prime editing with varying efficiencies. Prime editing shows higher or similar efficiency and fewer byproducts than homology-directed repair, has complementary strengths and weaknesses compared to base editing, and induces much lower off-target editing than Cas9 nuclease at known Cas9 off-target sites. Prime editing substantially expands the scope and capabilities of genome editing, and in principle could correct up to 89\% of known genetic variants associated with human diseases.},

The dynamic nature and functional role of the ERGIC have been debated for quite some time. In the most popular current view, the ERGIC clusters are mobile transport complexes that deliver secretory cargo from ER-exit sites to the Golgi. Recent live-cell imaging data revealing the formation of anterograde carriers from stationary ERGIC-53-positive membranes, however, suggest a stable compartment model in which ER-derived cargo is first shuttled from ER-exit sites to stationary ERGIC clusters in a COPII-dependent step and subsequently to the Golgi in a second vesicular transport step. This model can better accommodate previous morphological and functional data on ER-to-Golgi traffic. Such a stationary ERGIC would be a major site of anterograde and retrograde sorting that is controlled by coat proteins, Rab and Arf GTPases, as well as tethering complexes, SNAREs and cytoskeletal networks. The ERGIC also contributes to the concentration, folding, and quality control of newly synthesized proteins.},

Here we report efficient binding of purified ERGIC-53 to immobilized mannose at pH 7.4, the pH of the ER, but not at slightly lower pH. pH sensitivity of the lectin was more prominent when Ca2+ concentrations were low. A conserved histidine in the center of the carbohydrate recognition domain was required for lectin activity suggesting it may serve as a molecular pH/Ca2+ sensor. Acidification of cells inhibited the association of ERGIC-53 with the known cargo cathepsin Z-related protein and dissociation of this glycoprotein in the ERGIC was impaired by organelle neutralization that did not impair the transport of a control protein. The results elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying reversible lectin/cargo interaction and establish the ERGIC as the earliest low pH site of the secretory pathway.},

COPII recruitment to membranes is initiated by the activation of the small GTPase Sar1. We have utilized purified COPII components in both membrane recruitment and cargo export assays to analyze the possible role of kinase regulation in ER export. We now demonstrate that Sar1 recruitment to membranes requires ATP. We find that the serine/threonine kinase inhibitor H89 abolishes membrane recruitment of Sar1, thereby preventing COPII polymerization by interfering with the recruitment of the cytosolic Sec23/24 COPII coat complex. Inhibition of COPII recruitment prevents export of cargo from the ER. These results demonstrate that ER export and initiation of COPII vesicle formation in mammalian cells is under kinase regulation.},

  abstract = {Responses to many growth and stress conditions are assumed to act via changes to the cellular redox status. However, direct measurement of pH-adjusted redox state during growth and stress has never been carried out. Organellar redox state (E GSH) was measured using the fluorescent probes roGFP2 and pHluorin in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In particular, we investigated changes in organellar redox state in response to various growth and stress conditions to better understand the relationship between redox-, oxidative- and environmental stress response systems. E GSH values of the cytosol, mitochondrial matrix and peroxisome were determined in exponential and stationary phase in various media. These values (-340 to -350 mV) were more reducing than previously reported. Interestingly, sub-cellular redox state remained unchanged when cells were challenged with stresses previously reported to affect redox homeostasis. Only hydrogen peroxide and heat stress significantly altered organellar redox state. Hydrogen peroxide stress altered the redox state of the glutathione disulfide/glutathione couple (GSSG, 2H(+)/2GSH) and pH. Recovery from moderate hydrogen peroxide stress was most rapid in the cytosol, followed by the mitochondrial matrix, with the peroxisome the least able to recover. Conversely, the bulk of the redox shift observed during heat stress resulted from alterations in pH and not the GSSG, 2H(+)/2GSH couple. This study presents the first direct measurement of pH-adjusted redox state in sub-cellular compartments during growth and stress conditions. Redox state is distinctly regulated in organelles and data presented challenge the notion that perturbation of redox state is central in the response to many stress conditions.},

We show that the yeast t-snare phosphoprotein syntaxin5 (Sed5) acts as a key factor in mitigating proteotoxicity and the spatial deposition and clearance of IPOD (insoluble protein deposit) inclusions associates with the disaggregase Hsp104. Sed5 phosphorylation promotes dynamic movement of COPII-associated Hsp104 and boosts disaggregation by favoring anterograde ER-to-Golgi trafficking. Hsp104-associated aggregates co-localize with Sed5 as well as components of the ER, trans Golgi network, and endocytic vesicles, transiently during proteostatic stress, explaining mechanistically how misfolded and aggregated proteins formed at the vicinity of the ER can hitchhike toward vacuolar IPOD sites. Many inclusions become associated with mitochondria in a HOPS/vCLAMP-dependent manner and co-localize with Vps39 (HOPS/vCLAMP) and Vps13, which are proteins providing contacts between vacuole and mitochondria. Both Vps39 and Vps13 are required also for efficient Sed5dependent clearance of aggregates.},

Despite its fundamental importance, the mechanism(s) underlying this defect remains unclear. The v-ATPase, a multisubunit protein complex composed of cytosolic V1-sector and lysosomal membrane-anchored V0-sector, regulates lysosomal acidification. Mutations in the CLN1 gene, encoding PPT1, cause a devastating neurodegenerative LSD, INCL. Here we report that in Cln1-/- mice, which mimic INCL, reduced v-ATPase activity correlates with elevated lysosomal pH. Moreover, v-ATPase subunit a1 of the V0 sector (V0a1) requires palmitoylation for interacting with adaptor protein-2 (AP-2) and AP-3, respectively, for trafficking to the lysosomal membrane. Notably, treatment of Cln1-/- mice with a thioesterase (Ppt1)-mimetic, NtBuHA, ameliorated this defect. Our findings reveal an unanticipated role of Cln1 in regulating lysosomal targeting of V0a1 and suggest that varying factors adversely affecting v-ATPase function dysregulate lysosomal acidification in other LSDs and common neurodegenerative diseases.},

These proteins are thought to provide the specific targets that are recognized by transport vesicles. We have investigated the mechanism by which Sed5 protein is itself localized. Expression of epitope-tagged versions of the yeast, Drosophila and rat Sed5 homologues in COS cells results in a perinuclear distribution; immuno-EM reveals that the majority of the protein is in a tubulo-vesicular compartment on the cis side of the Golgi apparatus. A similar distribution was obtained with a chimeric molecule consisting of a plasma membrane syntaxin with the Drosophila Sed5 transmembrane domain. This indicates that the membrane-spanning domain contains targeting information, as is the case with resident Golgi enzymes. However, alterations to the transmembrane domain of Drosophila Sed5 itself did not result in its mistargeting, implying that an additional targeting mechanism exists which involves only the cytoplasmic part of the protein. This was confirmed by modifying the transmembrane domain of the yeast Sed5 protein: substitution with the corresponding region from the Sso1 protein (a plasma membrane syntaxin homologue) did not affect yeast Sed5 function in vivo.},

  abstract = {The glycoproteome, the ensemble of glycans and their carrier proteins, plays major roles in multicellular life by regulating cell interactions with their environment. How information is encoded into the glycome, in other words how glycosylation is modulated in response to signals, remains largely unclear. Glycosylation enzymes operate predominantly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi, a highly compartmentalized membrane-bound environment. Recent work indicates that this compartmentalization is plastic and tightly regulated. For instance, specific signals can induce the relocation of O-glycosylation enzymes, GALNTs, from the Golgi to the ER, resulting in significant upregulation of O-glycosylation initiation. We have named this re-compartmentation process the `GALA pathway'. GALA illustrates how membrane trafficking in the secretory pathway can regulate protein glycosylation and thus encode information in the glycome.},

  abstract = {The tyrosine kinase Src is present on the Golgi membranes. Its role, however, in the overall function and organization of the Golgi apparatus is unclear. We have found that in a cell line called SYF, which lacks the three ubiquitous Src-like kinases (Src, Yes, and Fyn), the organization of the Golgi apparatus is perturbed. The Golgi apparatus is composed of collapsed stacks and bloated cisternae in these cells. Expression of an activated form of Src relocated the KDEL receptor (KDEL-R) from the Golgi apparatus to the endoplasmic reticulum. Other Golgi-specific marker proteins were not affected under these conditions. Because of the specific effect of Src on the location of KDEL-R, we tested whether protein transport between ER and the Golgi apparatus involves Src. Transport of Pseudomonas exotoxin, which is transported to the ER by binding to the KDEL-R is accelerated by inhibition or genetic ablation of Src. Protein transport from ER to the Golgi apparatus however, is unaffected by Src deletion or inhibition. We propose that Src has an appreciable role in the organization of the Golgi apparatus, which may be linked to its involvement in protein transport from the Golgi apparatus to the endoplasmic reticulum.},

Vesicle formation requires GTP but can be driven by nonhydrolyzable analogs such as GMP-PNP. However, GMP-PNP vesicles fail to target and fuse with the Golgi complex whereas GTP vesicles are functional. All the cytosolic proteins required for vesicle formation are retained on GMP-PNP vesicles, while Sar1p dissociates from GTP vesicles. Thin section electron microscopy of purified preparations reveals a uniform population of 60\textendash 65 nm vesicles with a 10 nm thick electron dense coat. The subunits of this novel coat complex are molecularly distinct from the constituents of the nonclathrin coatomer involved in intra-Golgi transport. Because the overall cycle of budding driven by these two types of coats appears mechanistically similar, we propose that the coat structures be called COPI and COPII.},

GRASP65 is complexed with GM130 and is tightly bound to Golgi membranes, even under mitotic conditions when both are heavily phosphorylated.

While research into secretory stress signaling has so far mostly focused on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), emerging data suggest that the Golgi itself serves as an important signaling hub capable of initiating stress responses. To systematically identify novel Golgi stress mediators, we performed a transcriptomic analysis of cells exposed to three different pharmacological compounds known to elicit Golgi fragmentation: brefeldin A, golgicide A, and monensin. Subsequent gene-set enrichment analysis revealed a significant contribution of the ETS family transcription factors ELK1, GABPA/B, and ETS1 to the control of gene expression following compound treatment. Induction of Golgi stress leads to a late activation of the ETS upstream kinases MEK1/2 and ERK1/2, resulting in enhanced ETS factor activity and the transcription of ETS family target genes related to spliceosome function and cell death induction via alternate MCL1 splicing. Further genetic analyses using loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments suggest that these transcription factors operate in parallel.},

As correlative light electron microscopy (CLEM) approaches become increasingly accessible, long-standing neurobiological questions regarding structure-function relation are being revisited.

Mutations in members of the myotubularin family cause the human neuromuscular disorders myotubular myopathy and type 4B Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome. The crystal structure of a representative member of this family, MTMR2, reveals a phosphatase domain that is structurally unique among PTPs. A series of mutants are described that exhibit altered enzymatic activity and provide insight into the specificity of myotubularin phosphatases toward phosphoinositide substrates. The structure also reveals that the GRAM domain, found in myotubularin family phosphatases and predicted to occur in {$\sim$}180 proteins, is part of a larger motif with a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain fold. Finally, the MTMR2 structure will serve as a model for other members of the myotubularin family and provide a framework for understanding the mechanism whereby mutations in these proteins lead to disease.},

Here, by integrating crystallographic and deuterium-exchange mass spectrometry studies of human myotubularin-related protein-2 (MTMR2) in complex with phosphoinositides, we define the molecular basis for this unique substrate specificity. Phosphoinositide substrates bind in a pocket located on a positively charged face of the protein, suggesting an electrostatic mechanism for membrane targeting. A flexible, hydrophobic helix makes extensive interactions with the diacylglycerol moieties of substrates, explaining the specificity for membrane-bound phosphoinositides. An extensive H-bonding network and charge-charge interactions within the active site pocket determine phosphoinositide headgroup specificity. The conservation of these specificity determinants within the active, but not the inactive, myotubularins provides insight into the functional differences between the active and inactive members.},

C. (2004) J. Cell Biol. 167, 997-1003). COPII vesicles thus appear to contain all necessary components for homotypic tethering and fusion, providing a pathway for de novo VTC biogenesis. Here we demonstrate that antibodies against the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi SNARE Syntaxin 5 inhibit COPII vesicle homotypic tethering as well as fusion, implying an unanticipated role for SNAREs upstream of fusion. Inhibition of SNARE complex access and/or disassembly with dominant-negative alpha-soluble NSF attachment protein (SNAP) also inhibited tethering, implicating SNARE status as a critical determinant in COPII vesicle tethering. The tethering-defective vesicles generated in the presence of dominant-negative alpha-SNAP specifically lacked the Rab1 effectors p115 and GM130 but not other peripheral membrane proteins. Furthermore, Rab effectors, including p115, were shown to be required for homotypic COPII vesicle tethering. Thus, our results demonstrate a requirement for SNARE-dependent tether recruitment and function in COPII vesicle fusion. We anticipate that recruitment of tether molecules by an upstream SNARE signal ensures that tethering events are initiated only at focal sites containing appropriately poised fusion machinery.},

Previous work demonstrated that the highly conserved yeast Ltc/Lam sterol transporters localize and function at ER MCSs. Our analysis of the human family members, GRAMD1a and GRAMD2a, demonstrates that they are ER-PM MCS proteins, which mark separate regions of the plasma membrane (PM) and perform distinct functions in vivo. GRAMD2a, but not GRAMD1a, co-localizes with the E-Syt2/3 tethers at ER-PM contacts in a PIP lipid-dependent manner and pre-marks the subset of PI(4,5)P2-enriched ER-PM MCSs utilized for STIM1 recruitment. Data from an analysis of cells lacking GRAMD2a suggest that it is an organizer of ER-PM MCSs with pleiotropic functions including calcium homeostasis. Thus, our data demonstrate the existence of multiple ER-PM domains in human cells that are functionally specialized by GRAM-domain containing proteins.},

Included in the discussion is a description of these enzymes' glycan acceptors, conserved domain organization and sequences, molecular structure and catalytic mechanism. In addition, we discuss the protein interactions underlying the polysialylation of a select group of adhesion and signaling molecules. In the second section, the biosynthesis of sialic acid, CMP-sialic acid and sialylated N-glycans is discussed, with a special emphasis on the compartmentalization of these processes in the mammalian cell. The sequences and mechanisms maintaining the sialyltransferases and other glycosylation enzymes in the Golgi are also reviewed. In the final section, we have chosen to discuss processes in which sialylated glycans, both N- and O-linked, play a role. The first part of this section focuses on sialic acid-binding proteins including viral hemagglutinins, Siglecs and selectins. In the second half of this section, we comment on the role of sialylated N-glycans in cancer, including the roles of {$\beta$}1-integrin and Fas receptor N-glycan sialylation in cancer cell survival and drug resistance, and the role of these sialylated proteins and polysialic acid in cancer metastasis.},

The spatiotemporal restriction of different phosphoinositide species helps to define compartments within the cell, and this is particularly important for membrane trafficking within both the secretory and endocytic pathways. Phosphoinositide homoeostasis is tightly regulated by a large number of inositol kinases and phosphatases, which respectively phosphorylate and dephosphorylate distinct phosphoinositide species. Many of these enzymes have been implicated in regulating membrane trafficking and, accordingly, their dysregulation has been linked to a number of human diseases. In the present review, we focus on the inositol phosphatases, concentrating on their roles in membrane trafficking and the human diseases with which they have been associated.Abbreviations: A{$\beta$}, amyloid {$\beta$}-peptide; AD, Alzheimer's disease; ALS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; AP, adaptor protein; CCP, clathrin-coated pit; CMT, Charcot\textendash Marie\textendash Tooth; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ERGIC, endoplasmic reticulum\textendash Golgi intermediate compartment; GLUT4, glucose transporter type 4; INPP4, inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase; INPP5, inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase; LAMP2, lysosome-associated membrane protein 2; MORM, mental retardation, truncal obesity, retinal dystrophy and micropenis; MTM, myotubularin; MTMR, myotubularin-related; MVB, multivesicular body; NMDAR, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor; OCRL, oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PIPP, proline-rich inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase; PM, plasma membrane; PTEN, phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10; SAC, suppressor of actin; SH2, Src homology 2; SHIP, SH2 domain-containing inositol 5-phosphatase; SKIP, skeletal muscle and kidney inositol phosphatase; SNP, single nucleotide polymorphism; SNX9, sorting nexin 9; SYNJ, synaptojanin; TGN, trans-Golgi network; TMEM55, transmembrane protein 55; T-tubule, transverse tubule; Vps, vacuolar protein sorting; XLCNM, X-linked recessive form of centronuclear myopathy; YVS, Yunis\textendash Var\'on syndrome},

Human COG defects lead to severe multisystemic diseases known as COG-congenital disorders of glycosylation (COG-CDG). To gain better understanding of COG-CDGs, we compared COG knockout cells with cells deficient to 2 key enzymes, Alpha-1,3-mannosyl-glycoprotein 2-beta-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase and uridine diphosphate-glucose 4-epimerase (GALE), which contribute to proper N- and O-glycosylation. While all knockout cells share similar defects in glycosylation, these defects only account for a small fraction of observed COG knockout phenotypes. Glycosylation deficiencies were not associated with the fragmented Golgi, abnormal endolysosomes, defective sorting and secretion or delayed retrograde trafficking, indicating that these phenotypes are probably not due to hypoglycosylation, but to other specific interactions or roles of the COG complex. Importantly, these COG deficiency specific phenotypes were also apparent in COG7-CDG patient fibroblasts, proving the human disease relevance of our CRISPR knockout findings. The knowledge gained from this study has important implications, both for understanding the physiological role of COG complex in Golgi homeostasis in eukaryotic cells, and for better understanding human diseases associated with COG/Golgi impairment.},

Although this phenomenon has been observed for decades, it remains unknown how the secretory pathway responds to growth signaling. We demonstrate that control of Golgi phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI(4)P) is required for growth-dependent secretion. The phosphoinositide phosphatase SAC1 accumulates at the Golgi in quiescent cells and down-regulates anterograde trafficking by depleting Golgi PI(4)P. Golgi localization requires oligomerization of SAC1 and recruitment of the coat protein (COP) II complex. When quiescent cells are stimulated by mitogens, SAC1 rapidly shuttles back to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), thus releasing the brake on Golgi secretion. The p38 mitogen-activated kinase (MAPK) pathway induces dissociation of SAC1 oligomers after mitogen stimulation, which triggers COP-I\textendash mediated retrieval of SAC1 to the ER. Inhibition of p38 MAPK abolishes growth factor\textendash induced Golgi-to-ER shuttling of SAC1 and slows secretion. These results suggest direct roles for p38 MAPK and SAC1 in transmitting growth signals to the secretory machinery.},

Cross-presented peptides derive from internalized proteins, microbial pathogens, and transformed or dying cells. The physical separation of internalized cargo from the endoplasmic reticulum, where the machinery for assembling peptide\textendash MHC-I complexes resides, poses a challenge. To solve this problem, deliberate rewiring of organelle communication within cells is necessary to prepare for cross-presentation, and different endocytic receptors and vesicular traffic patterns customize the emergent cross-presentation compartment to the nature of the peptide source. Three distinct pathways of vesicular traffic converge to form the ideal cross-presentation compartment, each regulated differently to supply a unique component that enables cross-presentation of a diverse repertoire of peptides. Delivery of centerpiece MHC-I molecules is the critical step regulated by microbe-sensitive Toll-like receptors. Defining the subcellular sources of MHC-I and identifying sites of peptide loading during cross-presentation remain key challenges.},

Two papers used the CRISPR genome editing system and a gene trap method in haploid human cells to screen for essential genes (see the Perspective by Boone and Andrews). Wang et al.'s analysis of multiple cell lines indicates that it may be possible to find tumor-specific dependencies on particular genes. Blomen et al. investigate the phenomenon in which nonessential genes are required for fitness in the absence of another gene. Hence, complexity rather than robustness is the human strategy. Science, this issue p. 1096 and p. 1092; see also p. 1028 Although the genes essential for life have been identified in less complex model organisms, their elucidation in human cells has been hindered by technical barriers. We used extensive mutagenesis in haploid human cells to identify approximately 2000 genes required for optimal fitness under culture conditions. To study the principles of genetic interactions in human cells, we created a synthetic lethality network focused on the secretory pathway based exclusively on mutations. This revealed a genetic cross-talk governing Golgi homeostasis, an additional subunit of the human oligosaccharyltransferase complex, and a phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase {$\beta$} adaptor hijacked by viruses. The synthetic lethality map parallels observations made in yeast and projects a route forward to reveal genetic networks in diverse aspects of human cell biology. Systematic mutagenesis reveals essential genetic interactions required for human cells to keep growing.

Here we present the crystal structure of the yeast SM protein Sly1p in complex with a short N-terminal peptide derived from the Golgi-resident syntaxin Sed5p. Sly1p folds, similarly to neuronal Sec1, into a three-domain arch-shaped assembly, and Sed5p interacts in a helical conformation predominantly with domain I of Sly1p on the opposite site of the nSec1/syntaxin-1-binding site. Sequence conservation of the major interactions suggests that homologues of Sly1p as well as the paralogous Vps45p group bind their respective syntaxins in the same way. Furthermore, we present indirect evidence that nSec1 might be able to contact syntaxin 1 in a similar fashion. The observed Sly1p-Sed5p interaction mode therefore indicates how SM proteins can stay associated with the assembling fusion machinery in order to participate in late fusion steps.},

More than 100 different disorders have been reported and the number is rapidly increasing. Since glycosylation is an essential post-translational process, patients present a large range of symptoms and variable phenotypes, from very mild to extremely severe. Only for few CDG, potentially curative therapies are being used, including dietary supplementation (e.g., galactose for PGM1-CDG, fucose for SLC35C1-CDG, Mn2+ for TMEM165-CDG or mannose for MPI-CDG) and organ transplantation (e.g., liver for MPI-CDG and heart for DOLK-CDG). However, for the majority of patients, only symptomatic and preventive treatments are in use. This constitutes a burden for patients, care-givers and ultimately the healthcare system. Innovative diagnostic approaches, in vitro and in vivo models and novel biomarkers have been developed that can lead to novel therapeutic avenues aiming to ameliorate the patients' symptoms and lives. This review summarizes the advances in therapeutic approaches for CDG.},

These chaperones can be swept along the secretory pathway to the Golgi apparatus, from where they must be returned. For 20 years, cell biologists have known the identity of the KDEL (Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu) receptor responsible for this process, but the molecular basis for its function has remained elusive. Now, Br\"auer et al. present crystal structures of the KDEL receptor, in both the apo ER state and KDEL retrieval signal\textendash bound Golgi state. Comparisons of these two states identify the conformational switch that exposes the ER retrieval motif. The authors recapitulated the binding and release cycle of the receptor using purified components, confirming that the receptor is the minimal component required to bind KDEL ligands in the Golgi. Science, this issue p. 1103 Selective export and retrieval of proteins between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus is indispensable for eukaryotic cell function. An essential step in the retrieval of ER luminal proteins from the Golgi is the pH-dependent recognition of a carboxyl-terminal Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu (KDEL) signal by the KDEL receptor. Here, we present crystal structures of the chicken KDEL receptor in the apo ER state, KDEL-bound Golgi state, and in complex with an antagonistic synthetic nanobody (sybody). These structures show a transporter-like architecture that undergoes conformational changes upon KDEL binding and reveal a pH-dependent interaction network crucial for recognition of the carboxyl terminus of the KDEL signal. Complementary in vitro binding and in vivo cell localization data explain how these features create a pH-dependent retrieval system in the secretory pathway. Transporter-like architecture facilitates pH-dependent protein retrieval within the secretory pathway.

Here we show that the yeast ER-SNARE Ufe1, a syntaxin (Qa-SNARE) involved in ER membrane fusion and retrograde transport from the Golgi to the ER, is prone to degradation by an ERAD-like mechanism. Notably, Ufe1 is protected against degradation through binding to Sly1, a known SNARE regulator of the Sec1?Munc18 (SM) protein family. This mechanism is specific for Ufe1, as the stability of another Sly1 partner, the Golgi Qa-SNARE Sed5, is not influenced by Sly1 interaction. Thus, our findings identify Sly1 as a discriminating regulator of SNARE levels and indicate that Sly1-controlled ERAD might regulate the balance between different Qa-SNARE proteins.},

Of particular utility and convenience for making permanently transfected polarized cell lines are those that also direct expression of a selectable marker. Several methods of transfecting cells are available, but the polybrene method is recommended for MDCK cells because it is effective, easy, and inexpensive. After transfection, cells are replated in a selective drug for 10-14 days to kill untransfected cells; then surviving colonies are cloned with cloning rings. Screening of these colonies for expression of the desired protein ordinarily yields 10-15\% cell lines with sufficiently high expression to be useful. It should not be assumed that every clone of a polarized cell line will be properly polarized, particularly in the case of MDCK cells. However, assays for correct sorting of endogenous markers can be used to verify proper polarity of transfectants or to identify well-polarized untransfected clones to be transfected. Using these methods and CMV vectors, one can easily establish one or more permanently transfected polarized cell lines within about 1 mo.},

Despite a different clinical presentation they all have a progressive course leading to severe disability and share similar pathologic findings at the muscle biopsy. Quadriceps-sparing autosomal recessive hereditary inclusion-body myopathy (h-IBM) is the commonest form and is tied to mutations of the UDP-Nacetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (GNE) that codes for a rate-limiting enzyme in the sialic acid biosynthetic pathway. Despite the identification of the causative gene defect, it has not been clarified how mutations of the GNE gene impair muscle homeostasis. Although several lines of evidence argue in favor of an abnormal sialylation of muscle glycoproteins playing a key role in h-IBM pathogenesis, others studies have demonstrated new functions of the GNE gene, outside the sialic acid biosynthetic pathway, that may also be relevant. This review illustrates the clinical and pathologic characteristics of h- IBM and the main clues available to date concerning the possible pathogenic mechanisms of this disorder. Understanding the molecular mechanism underlying h-IBM pathology is a fundamental requisite to plan a future attempt to therapy.},

Lipids like cholesterol and sphingomyelin are gradually enriched along the secretory pathway, with their highest concentration at the plasma membrane. How a cell succeeds in maintaining organelle-specific lipid compositions, despite a steady flow of incoming and outgoing transport carriers along the secretory pathway, is not yet clear. Transport and sorting along the secretory pathway of both proteins and most lipids are thought to be mediated by vesicular transport, with coat protein I (COPI) vesicles operating in the early secretory pathway. Although the protein constituents of these transport intermediates are characterized in great detail, much less is known about their lipid content. Using nano-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry for quantitative lipid analysis of COPI-coated vesicles and their parental Golgi membranes, we find only low amounts of sphingomyelin and cholesterol in COPI-coated vesicles compared with their donor Golgi membranes, providing evidence for a significant segregation from COPI vesicles of these lipids. In addition, our data indicate a sorting of individual sphingomyelin molecular species. The possible molecular mechanisms underlying this segregation, as well as implications on COPI function, are discussed.},

However, the mechanisms by which these sugars modulate antitumor immunity as well as therapeutic strategies directed against them are limited. Here we report that intratumoral injections with a sialic acid mimetic Ac53FaxNeu5Ac block tumor sialic acid expression in vivo and suppress tumor growth in multiple tumor models. Sialic acid blockade had a major impact on the immune cell composition of the tumor, enhancing tumor-infiltrating natural killer cell and CD8+ T-cell numbers while reducing regulatory T-cell and myeloid regulatory cell numbers. Sialic acid blockade enhanced cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell\textendash mediated killing of tumor cells in part by facilitating antigen-specific T-cell\textendash tumor cell clustering. Sialic acid blockade also synergized with adoptive transfer of tumor-specific CD8+ T cells in vivo and enhanced CpG immune adjuvant therapy by increasing dendritic cell activation and subsequent CD8+ T-cell responses. Collectively, these data emphasize the crucial role of sialic acids in tumor immune evasion and provide proof of concept that sialic acid blockade creates an immune-permissive tumor microenvironment for CD8+ T-cell\textendash mediated tumor immunity, either as single treatment or in combination with other immune-based intervention strategies. Significance: Sialic acid sugars function as important modulators of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment that limit potent antitumor immunity.

Here, we engineered a novel genetically encoded pH probe by fusing the pH-stable cyan fluorescent protein (FP) variant, mTurquoise2, to the highly pH-sensitive enhanced yellow fluorescent protein, EYFP. This approach yielded a ratiometric biosensor\textemdash referred to as pH-Lemon\textemdash optimized for live imaging of distinct pH conditions within acidic cellular compartments. Protonation of pH-Lemon under acidic conditions significantly decreases the yellow fluorescence while the cyan fluorescence increases due to reduced F\"orster resonance energy transfer (FRET) efficiency. Because of its freely reversible and ratiometric responses, pH-Lemon represents a fluorescent biosensor for pH dynamics. pH-Lemon also shows a sizable pH-dependent fluorescence lifetime change that can be used in fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy as an alternative observation method for the study of pH in acidic cellular compartments. Fusion of pH-Lemon to the protein microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3B (LC3B), a specific marker of autophagic membranes, resulted in its targeting within autolysosomes of HeLa cells. Moreover, fusion of pH-Lemon to a glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor allowed us to monitor the entire luminal space of the secretory pathway and the exoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane. Utilizing this new pH probe, we revealed neutral and acidic vesicles and substructures inside cells, highlighting compartments of distinct pH throughout the endomembrane system.

To determine the function of Scyl1, we have now used a mass spectrometry-based screen to search for Scyl1-binding partners and identified components of coatomer I (COPI) coats. The interaction was confirmed in pull-down assays, and Scyl1 co-immunoprecipitates with betaCOP from brain lysates. Interestingly, and unique for a non-transmembrane domain protein, Scyl1 binds COPI coats using a C-terminal RKLD-COO(-) sequence, similar to the KKXX-COO(-) COPI-binding motif found in transmembrane endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteins. Scyl1 co-localizes with betaCOP and is localized, in an Arf1-independent manner, to the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment and the cis-Golgi, sites of COPI-mediated membrane budding. The localization and binding properties of Scyl1 strongly suggest a function in COPI transport, and inhibitory RNA-mediated knock down of the protein disrupts COPI-mediated retrograde traffic of the KDEL receptor to the ER without affecting anterograde traffic from the ER. Our data demonstrate a function for Scyl1 as an accessory factor in COPI trafficking and suggest for the first time that alterations in the COPI pathway result in neurodegenerative disease.},

Using a nanobody against GFP, our tool is widely applicable to any GFP-tagged protein of interest. It allows the quantitative analysis of endocytic and retrograde transport biochemically, by fixed- and live-cell imaging and by electron microscopy. As proof-of-principle, we applied them to determine the contribution of adaptor protein-1/clathrin in retrograde transport of the mannose-6-phosphate receptors to the trans-Golgi.Retrograde transport of membranes and proteins from the cell surface to the Golgi and beyond is essential to maintain homeostasis, compartment identity, and physiological functions. To study retrograde traffic biochemically, by live-cell imaging or by electron microscopy, we engineered functionalized anti-GFP nanobodies (camelid VHH antibody domains) to be bacterially expressed and purified. Tyrosine sulfation consensus sequences were fused to the nanobody for biochemical detection of trans-Golgi arrival, fluorophores for fluorescence microscopy and live imaging, and APEX2 (ascorbate peroxidase 2) for electron microscopy and compartment ablation. These functionalized nanobodies are specifically captured by GFP-modified reporter proteins at the cell surface and transported piggyback to the reporters' homing compartments. As an application of this tool, we have used it to determine the contribution of adaptor protein-1/clathrin in retrograde transport kinetics of the mannose-6-phosphate receptors from endosomes back to the trans-Golgi network.

Working with liposomes resembles physiological conditions more than protein--lipid overlay assays, which makes this method less prone to detect false positive interactions. However, liposome lipid composition must be well-considered in order to prevent nonspecific binding of the protein through electrostatic interactions with negatively charged lipids like phosphatidylserine. In this protocol we use the PROPPIN Hsv2 (homologous with swollen vacuole phenotype 2) as an example to demonstrate the influence of liposome lipid composition on binding and show how phosphoinositide binding specificities of a protein can be characterized with this method.},

  abstract = {Background and Aims Vacuolar H+-ATP complex (V-ATPase) is a multisubunit protein complex required for acidification of intracellular compartments. At least five different factors are known to be essential for its assembly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Genetic defects in four of these V-ATPase assembly factors show overlapping clinical features, including steatotic liver disease and mild hypercholesterolemia. An exception is the assembly factor vacuolar ATPase assembly integral membrane protein (VMA21), whose X-linked mutations lead to autophagic myopathy. Approach and Results Here, we report pathogenic variants in VMA21 in male patients with abnormal protein glycosylation that result in mild cholestasis, chronic elevation of aminotransferases, elevation of (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol and steatosis in hepatocytes. We also show that the VMA21 variants lead to V-ATPase misassembly and dysfunction. As a consequence, lysosomal acidification and degradation of phagocytosed materials are impaired, causing lipid droplet (LD) accumulation in autolysosomes. Moreover, VMA21 deficiency triggers ER stress and sequestration of unesterified cholesterol in lysosomes, thereby activating the sterol response element-binding protein?mediated cholesterol synthesis pathways. Conclusions Together, our data suggest that impaired lipophagy, ER stress, and increased cholesterol synthesis lead to LD accumulation and hepatic steatosis. V-ATPase assembly defects are thus a form of hereditary liver disease with implications for the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.},

  abstract = {Parasitophorous vacuoles (PV) that harbour Leishmania parasites acquire some characteristics from fusion with host cell vesicles. Recent studies have shown that PVs acquire and display resident endoplasmic reticulum (ER) molecules. We investigated the importance of ER molecules to PV biology by assessing the consequence of blocking the fusion of PVs with vesicles that originate from the early secretory pathway. This was achieved by targeting the N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) that mediate the fusion of early secretory vesicles. In the presence of dominant negative variants of sec22b or some of its known cognate partners, D12 and syntaxin 18, PVs failed to distend and harboured fewer parasites. These observations were confirmed in studies in which each of the SNAREs listed above including the intermediate compartment ER/Golgi SNARE, syntaxin 5, was knocked down. The knock-down of these SNARES had little or no measurable effect on the morphology of the ER or on activated secretion even though they resulted in a more significant reduction of PV size. Moreover, the knock-down of the ER/Golgi SNAREs resulted in significant reduction in parasite replication. Taken together, these studies provide further evidence that PVs acquire ER components by fusing with vesicles derived from the early secretory pathway; disruption of this interaction results in inhibition of the development of PVs as well as the limitation of parasite replication within infected cells.},

PCCs navigate around a wide range of host cell vesicles and organelles. In light of the perils of engaging with vesicles of the endocytic pathway, most PCCs modulate their interactions with endocytic vesicles while a few avoid those interactions. The secretory pathway constitutes another important grouping of vesicles and organelles in host cells. Although the negative consequences of engaging with the secretory pathway are not known, there is evidence that PCCs interact differentially with vesicles and organelles in this pathway as well. In this review, we consider three prokaryote pathogens and two protozoan parasites for which there is information on the interactions of their PCCs with the secretory pathway. Current understandings of the molecular interactions as well as the metabolic benefits that accompany those interactions are discussed. Not unexpectedly, our understanding of the extent of these interactions is variable. An underlying theme that is brought to the fore is that PCCs establish preferential interactions with distinct compartments of the secretory pathway.},

In this study, we took advantage of the recent identification of Retro-2, a small organic molecule that can cause the redistribution of syntaxin-5; we show herein that Retro-2 blocks LPV development within 2 hours of adding it to cells infected with \emph{Leishmania amazonensis}. In infected cells incubated for 48 hours with Retro-2, LPV development was significantly limited; furthermore, infected cells harbored four to five times fewer parasites than infected cells incubated in vehicle alone. \emph{In vivo} studies revealed that Retro-2 curbed experimental \emph{L. amazonensis} infections in a dose-dependent manner. Retro-2 did not have any appreciable effect on the host cell physiological characteristics; furthermore, it had no apparent toxicity in experimental animals. An unexpected, but welcome, finding was that Retro-2 inhibited the replication of \emph{Leishmania} parasites in axenic cultures. This study is significant because it identifies an endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi SNARE as a potential target for the control of \emph{Leishmania} infections; moreover, it suggests that small organic molecules can be identified that can selectively disrupt the vesicle fusion machinery that promotes the development of pathogen-containing compartments without exerting toxic effects on the host.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Subcellular fractionation experiments demonstrate that the ER/Golgi SNAREs Bos1p, Sec22p, Bet1p, Sed5p, and the Rab protein, Ypt1p, are distributed similarly but localize primarily with Golgi membranes. All of these SNARE proteins are efficiently packaged into COPII vesicles and suggest a dynamic cycling of SNARE machinery between ER and Golgi compartments. Ypt1p is not efficiently packaged into vesicles under these conditions. To determine in which membranes protein function is required, temperature-sensitive alleles of BOS1, BET1, SED5, SLY1, and YPT1 that prevent ER/Golgi transport in vitro at restrictive temperatures were used to selectively inactivate these gene products on vesicles or on Golgi membranes. Vesicles bearing mutations in Bet1p or Bos1p inhibit fusion with wild-type acceptor membranes, but acceptor membranes containing these mutations are fully functional. In contrast, vesicles bearing mutations in Sed5p, Sly1p, or Ypt1p are functional, whereas acceptor membranes containing these mutations block fusion. Thus, this set of SNARE proteins is symmetrically distributed between vesicle and acceptor compartments, but they function asymmetrically such that Bet1p and Bos1p are required on vesicles and Sed5p activity is required on acceptor membranes. We propose the asymmetry in SNARE protein function is maintained by an asymmetric distribution and requirement for the Ypt1p GTPase in this fusion event. When a transmembrane-anchored form of Ypt1p is used to restrict this GTPase to the acceptor compartment, vesicles depleted of Ypt1p remain competent for fusion.},

These two surfaces are characterized by markedly different protein compositions, reflecting the ability of the cell to target newly synthesized membrane proteins to specific regions of the cell surface. This targeting capability is also apparent in the polarized release of secretory products. Recent studies using canine renal tubule (MDCK) cells have suggested that distinct sets of secretory proteins are released from their apical and basolateral poles. We report experiments designed to examine secretory protein sorting by MDCK cells. We have shown that secretion of basement membrane components (laminin and heparan sulphate proteoglycan (HSPG] takes place from the basolateral cell surface and that this polarized release results from active sorting. The sorting process which mediates this polarized secretion requires an acidic intracellular compartment. MDCK cells treated with NH4Cl to raise the pH of their intracellular compartments, secrete laminin and HSPG by a default pathway which leads to their release in roughly equal quantities into the medium of both the apical and basolateral compartments.},

What is emerging is a picture of SM proteins acting not merely as SNARE regulators, but also as central components of the membrane fusion apparatus.

Recent studies suggest that the state of glycosylation of lysosomal membrane proteins may play a role in disease progression. Our study has identified the presence of a highly glycosylated form of Lysosome Associated Membrane Protein 1 (LAMP1) that correlated spatiotemporally with Purkinje neuron loss. This form of LAMP1 was predominantly localized to activated microglia; showing a \textasciitilde 5-fold increase in surface labeling by FACS analysis. This suggests a potential role for LAMP1 in the neuro-inflammatory process in these mice during disease progression. Analysis of other mouse models of neurodegeneration that exhibit neuro-inflammation showed little or no presence of this glycosylated form of LAMP1, suggesting this observation for LAMP1 is specific to NPC disease. Furthermore, early treatment of Npc1-/- mice with 2-hydroxypropyl-{$\beta$}-cyclodextrin (HP{$\beta$}CD), significantly prevented the appearance of the glycosylated LAMP1 in the cerebellum of Npc1-/- mice at 7 weeks, consistent with the prevention of neuro-inflammation in mice treated with this drug. Treatment of Npc1-/- mice with HP{$\beta$}CD at 7 weeks, after disease onset, did not reverse or prevent further appearance of the hyperglycosylated LAMP1, demonstrating that once this aspect of neuro-inflammation began, it continued despite the HP{$\beta$}CD treatment. Analysis of LAMP1 in cerebellar tissue of NPC1 patients showed a small level of hyperglycosylated LAMP1 in the tissue, however, this was not seen in the CSF of patients.},

Much has been learned about how environmentally triggered signaling pathways regulate ER function, but only little is known about local signaling at the ER. The identification of ER-resident signaling molecules will help gain a deeper understanding of the regulation of ER function and thus of proteostasis. Here, we show that leukocyte tyrosine kinase (LTK) is an ER-resident receptor tyrosine kinase. Depletion of LTK as well as its pharmacologic inhibition reduces the number of ER exit sites and slows ER-to-Golgi transport. Furthermore, we show that LTK interacts with and phosphorylates Sec12. Expression of a phosphoablating mutant of Sec12 reduces the efficiency of ER export. Thus, LTK-to-Sec12 signaling represents the first example of an ER-resident signaling module with the potential to regulate proteostasis.},

GORAB, the responsible disease gene, encodes a small Golgi protein of poorly characterized function. To circumvent neonatal lethality of the GorabNull full knockout, Gorab was conditionally inactivated in mesenchymal progenitor cells (Prx1-cre), pre-osteoblasts (Runx2-cre), and late osteoblasts/osteocytes (Dmp1-cre), respectively. While in all three lines a reduction in trabecular bone density was evident, only GorabPrx1 and GorabRunx2 mutants showed dramatically thinned, porous cortical bone and spontaneous fractures. Collagen fibrils in the skin of GorabNull mutants and in bone of GorabPrx1 mutants were disorganized, which was also seen in a bone biopsy from a GO patient. Measurement of glycosaminoglycan contents revealed a reduction of dermatan sulfate levels in skin and cartilage from GorabNull mutants. In bone from GorabPrx1 mutants total glycosaminoglycan levels and the relative percentage of dermatan sulfate were both strongly diminished. Accordingly, the proteoglycans biglycan and decorin showed reduced glycanation. Also in cultured GORAB-deficient fibroblasts reduced decorin glycanation was evident. The Golgi compartment of these cells showed an accumulation of decorin, but reduced signals for dermatan sulfate. Moreover, we found elevated activation of TGF-{$\beta$} in GorabPrx1 bone tissue leading to enhanced downstream signalling, which was reproduced in GORAB-deficient fibroblasts. Our data suggest that the loss of Gorab primarily perturbs pre-osteoblasts. GO may be regarded as a congenital disorder of glycosylation affecting proteoglycan synthesis due to delayed transport and impaired posttranslational modification in the Golgi compartment.},

One such setting is represented by the frequent CDKN2A deletion in human cancer that, through inactivation of p14ARF, activates MDM2 protein, which in turn degrades TP53 tumor suppressor. Here we used piggyBac (PB) transposon insertional mutagenesis to anticipate resistance mechanisms occurring during treatment with the MDM2-TP53 inhibitor HDM201. Constitutive PB mutagenesis in Arf(-/-) mice provided a collection of spontaneous tumors with characterized insertional genetic landscapes. Tumors were allografted in large cohorts of mice to assess the pharmacologic effects of HDM201. Sixteen out of 21 allograft models were sensitive to HDM201 but ultimately relapsed under treatment. A comparison of tumors with acquired resistance to HDM201 and untreated tumors identified 87 genes that were differentially and significantly targeted by the PB transposon. Resistant tumors displayed a complex clonality pattern suggesting the emergence of several resistant subclones. Among the most frequent alterations conferring resistance, we observed somatic and insertional loss-of-function mutations in transformation-related protein 53 (Trp53) in 54\% of tumors and transposon-mediated gain-of-function alterations in B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-xL), Mdm4, and two TP53 family members, resulting in expression of the TP53 dominant negative truncations {$\Delta$}NTrp63 and {$\Delta$}NTrp73. Enhanced BCL-xL and MDM4 protein expression was confirmed in resistant tumors, as well as in HDM201-resistant patient-derived tumor xenografts. Interestingly, concomitant inhibition of MDM2 and BCL-xL demonstrated significant synergy in p53 wild-type cell lines in vitro. Collectively, our findings identify several potential mechanisms by which TP53 wild-type tumors may escape MDM2-targeted therapy.},

  abstract = {The ST6Gal I is a sialyltransferase that functions in the late Golgi to modify the N-linked oligosaccharides of glycoproteins. The ST6Gal I is expressed as two isoforms with a single amino acid difference in their catalytic domains. The STcys isoform is stably retained in the cell and is predominantly found in the Golgi, whereas the STtyr isoform is only transiently localized in the Golgi and is cleaved and secreted from a post-Golgi compartment. These two ST6Gal I isoforms were used to explore the role of the bilayer thickness mechanism and oligomerization in Golgi localization. Analysis of STcys and STtyr proteins with longer transmembrane regions suggested that the bilayer thickness mechanism is not the predominant mechanism used for ST6Gal I Golgi localization. In contrast, the formation and quantity of Triton X-100-insoluble oligomers was correlated with the stable or transient localization of the ST6Gal I isoforms in the Golgi. Nearly 100\% of the STcys and only 13\% of the STtyr were found as Triton-insoluble oligomers when Golgi membranes of COS-1 cells expressing these proteins were solubilized at pH 6.3, the pH of the late Golgi. In contrast, both proteins were found in the soluble fraction when these membranes were solubilized at pH 8.0. Analysis of other mutants suggested that a conformational change in the catalytic domain rather than increased disulfide bond-based cross-linking is the basis for the increased ability of STcys protein to form oligomers and the stable localization of STcys protein in the Golgi.},

  abstract = {Structured Abstract IntroductionIn vivo imaging provides a window into the spatially complex, rapidly evolving physiology of the cell that structural imaging alone cannot. However, observing this physiology directly involves inevitable tradeoffs of spatial resolution, temporal resolution, and phototoxicity. This is especially true when imaging in three dimensions, which is essential to obtain a complete picture of many dynamic subcellular processes. Although traditional in vivo imaging tools, such as widefield and confocal microscopy, and newer ones, such as light-sheet microscopy, can image in three dimensions, they sacrifice substantial spatiotemporal resolution to do so and, even then, can often be used for only very limited durations before altering the physiological state of the specimen. {$<$}img class="highwire-embed" alt="Embedded Image" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/highwire/sci/346/6208/1257998/embed/inline-graphic-1.gif"/{$>$}Lattice light-sheet microscopy. An ultrathin structured light sheet (blue-green, center) excites fluorescence (orange) in successive planes as it sweeps through a specimen (gray) to generate a 3D image. The speed, noninvasiveness, and high spatial resolution of this approach make it a promising tool for in vivo 3D imaging of fast dynamic processes in cells and embryos, as shown here in five surrounding examples. Lattice light-sheet microscopy. An ultrathin structured light sheet (blue-green, center) excites fluorescence (orange) in successive planes as it sweeps through a specimen (gray) to generate a 3D image. The speed, noninvasiveness, and high spatial resolution of this approach make it a promising tool for in vivo 3D imaging of fast dynamic processes in cells and embryos, as shown here in five surrounding examples. RationaleTo address these limitations, we developed a new microscope using ultrathin light sheets derived from two-dimensional (2D) optical lattices. These are scanned plane-by-plane through the specimen to generate a 3D image. The thinness of the sheet leads to high axial resolution and negligible photobleaching and background outside of the focal plane, while its simultaneous illumination of the entire field of view permits imaging at hundreds of planes per second even at extremely low peak excitation intensities. By implementing either superresolution structured illumination or by dithering the lattice to create a uniform light sheet, we imaged cells and small embryos in three dimensions, often at subsecond intervals, for hundreds to thousands of time points at the diffraction limit and beyond. ResultsWe demonstrated the technique on 20 different biological processes spanning four orders of magnitude in space and time, including the binding kinetics of single Sox2 transcription factor molecules, 3D superresolution photoactivated localization microscopy of nuclear lamins, dynamic organelle rearrangements and 3D tracking of microtubule plus ends during mitosis, neutrophil motility in a collagen mesh, and subcellular protein localization and dynamics during embryogenesis in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. Throughout, we established the performance advantages of lattice light-sheet microscopy compared with previous techniques and highlighted phenomena that, when seen at increased spatiotemporal detail, may hint at previously unknown biological mechanisms. ConclusionPhotobleaching and phototoxicity are typically reduced by one to two orders of magnitude relative to that seen with a 1D scanned Bessel beam or the point array scanned excitation of spinning disk confocal microscopy. This suggests that the instantaneous peak power delivered to the specimen may be an even more important metric of cell health than the total photon dose and should enable extended 3D observation of endogenous levels of even sparsely expressed proteins produced by genome editing. Improvements of similar magnitude in imaging speed and a twofold gain in axial resolution relative to confocal microscopy yield 4D spatiotemporal resolution high enough to follow fast, nanoscale dynamic processes that would otherwise be obscured by poor resolution along one or more axes of spacetime. Last, the negligible background makes lattice light-sheet microscopy a promising platform for the extension of all methods of superresolution to larger and more densely fluorescent specimens and enables the study of signaling, transport, and stochastic self-assembly in complex environments with single-molecule sensitivity. From single molecules to embryos in living color Animation defines life, and the three-dimensional (3D) imaging of dynamic biological processes occurring within living specimens is essential to understand life. However, in vivo imaging, especially in 3D, involves inevitable tradeoffs of resolution, speed, and phototoxicity. Chen et al. describe a microscope that can address these concerns. They used a class of nondiffracting beams, known as 2D optical lattices, which spread the excitation energy across the entire field of view while simultaneously eliminating out-of-focus excitation. Lattice light sheets increase the speed of image acquisition and reduce phototoxicity, which expands the range of biological problems that can be investigated. The authors illustrate the power of their approach using 20 distinct biological systems ranging from single-molecule binding kinetics to cell migration and division, immunology, and embryonic development. Science, this issue 10.1126/science.1257998 Although fluorescence microscopy provides a crucial window into the physiology of living specimens, many biological processes are too fragile, are too small, or occur too rapidly to see clearly with existing tools. We crafted ultrathin light sheets from two-dimensional optical lattices that allowed us to image three-dimensional (3D) dynamics for hundreds of volumes, often at subsecond intervals, at the diffraction limit and beyond. We applied this to systems spanning four orders of magnitude in space and time, including the diffusion of single transcription factor molecules in stem cell spheroids, the dynamic instability of mitotic microtubules, the immunological synapse, neutrophil motility in a 3D matrix, and embryogenesis in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. The results provide a visceral reminder of the beauty and the complexity of living systems. A new microscope allows three-dimensional imaging of living systems at very high resolution in real time.

Here we present evidence for a different mechanism in which two sets of endolysosomal proteins undergo early segregation to distinct domains of the Golgi complex by virtue of the proteins' luminal and transmembrane domains. Proteins in one Golgi domain exit into predominantly vesicular carriers by interaction of sorting signals with adaptor proteins, but proteins in the other domain exit into predominantly tubular carriers shared with plasma membrane proteins, independently of signal\textendash adaptor interactions. These findings demonstrate that sorting of endolysosomal proteins begins at an earlier stage and involves mechanisms that partly differ from those described by classical models.},

  abstract = {The Golgi apparatus has many important physiological functions, including sorting of secretory cargo and biosynthesis of complex glycans. These functions depend on the intricate and compartmentalized organization of the Golgi apparatus. To investigate the mechanisms that regulate Golgi architecture, we developed a quantitative morphological assay using three different Golgi compartment markers and quantitative image analysis, and performed a kinome- and phosphatome-wide RNAi screen in HeLa cells. Depletion of 159 signaling genes, nearly 20\% of genes assayed, induced strong and varied perturbations in Golgi morphology. Using bioinformatics data, a large regulatory network could be constructed. Specific subnetworks are involved in phosphoinositides regulation, acto-myosin dynamics and mitogen activated protein kinase signaling. Most gene depletion also affected Golgi functions, in particular glycan biosynthesis, suggesting that signaling cascades can control glycosylation directly at the Golgi level. Our results provide a genetic overview of the signaling pathways that control the Golgi apparatus in human cells.Mol Syst Biol. 8: 629},

We report here the identification of zinc finger protein-like 1 (ZFPL1) as a novel structural component of the Golgi apparatus. ZFPL1 is a conserved and widely expressed integral membrane protein with two predicted zinc fingers at the N-terminus, the second of which is a likely ring domain. ZFPL1 directly interacts with the cis-Golgi matrix protein GM130. Depletion of ZFPL1 results in the accumulation of cis-Golgi matrix proteins in the intermediate compartment (IC) and the tubulation of cis-Golgi and IC membranes. Loss of ZFPL1 function also impairs cis-Golgi assembly following brefeldin A washout and slows the rate of cargo trafficking into the Golgi apparatus. Effects upon Golgi matrix protein localization and cis-Golgi structure can be rescued by wild-type ZFPL1 but not mutants defective in GM130 binding. Together, these data suggest that ZFPL1 has an important function in maintaining the integrity of the cis-Golgi and that it does so through interactions with GM130.},

A troublesome aspect of these diseases are the neurological pathologies such as low IQ, microcephaly and cerebellar atrophy. The essential function of the COG complex is dependent upon interactions with other components of trafficking machinery, such as Rab-GTPases and SNAREs.

Therefore, we permanently anchored key subunits of COG subcomplexes (COG4, COG7, and COG8) to Golgi membranes using transmembrane protein TMEM115 (TMEM-COG). All TMEM-COG subunits tested were Golgi localized, integrated into the COG complex, and stabilized membrane association of endogenous subunits. Interestingly, TMEM-COG4 and TMEM-COG7 equally rescued COG function in organization of Golgi markers, glycosylation, and abundance of COG-sensitive proteins. In contrast, TMEM-COG8 was not as effective, indicating that N-terminal attachment of COG8 interfered with overall COG structure and function, and none of the TMEM-COG subunits rescued the abnormal Golgi architecture caused by COG knockout. Collectively, these data indicate that both subcomplexes of the COG complex can perform most of COG function when permanently attached to membranes and that the cytosolic pool of COG is not completely essential to COG function.},

Here we address the extent to which proteins that leave the ER and localize to distal sites in the secretory pathway are able to return to the ER folding environment during their lifetime. Retrieval of proteins back to the ER was studied using an assay based on the capacity of the ER to retain misfolded proteins. The lumenal domain of the temperature-sensitive viral glycoprotein VSVGtsO45 was fused to Golgi or plasma membrane targeting domains. At the nonpermissive temperature, newly synthesized fusion proteins misfolded and were retained in the ER, indicating the VSVGtsO45 ectodomain was sufficient for their retention within the ER. At the permissive temperature, the fusion proteins were correctly delivered to the Golgi complex or plasma membrane, indicating the lumenal epitope of VSVGtsO45 also did not interfere with proper targeting of these molecules. Strikingly, Golgi-localized fusion proteins, but not VSVGtsO45 itself, were found to redistribute back to the ER upon a shift to the nonpermissive temperature, where they misfolded and were retained. This occurred over a time period of 15 min\textendash 2 h depending on the chimera, and did not require new protein synthesis. Significantly, recycling did not appear to be induced by misfolding of the chimeras within the Golgi complex. This suggested these proteins normally cycle between the Golgi and ER, and while passing through the ER at 40\textdegree C become misfolded and retained. The attachment of the thermosensitive VSVGtsO45 lumenal domain to proteins promises to be a useful tool for studying the molecular mechanisms and specificity of retrograde traffic to the ER.},

  abstract = {The Golgi apparatus is the central hub of intracellular trafficking and consists of tethered stacks of cis, medial, and trans cisternae. In mammalian cells, these cisternae are stitched together as a perinuclear Golgi ribbon, which is required for the establishment of cell polarity and normal subcellular organization. We previously identified FHDC1 (also known as INF1) as a unique microtubule-binding member of the formin family of cytoskeletal-remodeling proteins. We show here that endogenous FHDC1 regulates Golgi ribbon formation and has an apparent preferential association with the Golgi-derived microtubule network. Knockdown of FHDC1 expression results in defective Golgi assembly and suggests a role for FHDC1 in maintenance of the Golgi-derived microtubule network. Similarly, overexpression of FHDC1 induces dispersion of the Golgi ribbon into functional ministacks. This effect is independent of centrosome-derived microtubules and instead likely requires the interaction between the FHDC1 microtubule-binding domain and the Golgi-derived microtubule network. These effects also depend on the interaction between the FHDC1 FH2 domain and the actin cytoskeleton. Thus our results suggest that the coordination of actin and microtubule dynamics by FHDC1 is required for normal Golgi ribbon formation.},

An identical-by-descent, homozygous mutation in GOSR2 (c.430G{$>$}T, p.Gly144Trp), a Golgi vesicle transport gene, was identified in this patient and in four apparently unrelated individuals. A comparison of the phenotypes in these patients defined a clinically distinct PME syndrome characterized by early-onset ataxia, action myoclonus by age 6, scoliosis, and mildly elevated serum~creatine kinase. This p.Gly144Trp mutation is equivalent to a loss of function and results in failure of GOSR2 protein to localize to the cis-Golgi.},

We have~determined that EV-D68 induces autophagic signaling and membrane formation. Autophagy, a homeostatic degradative process that breaks down protein aggregates and damaged organelles, promotes replication of multiple plus-strand viruses. Induction of autophagic signals promotes EV-D68 replication, but the virus inhibits the downstream degradative steps of autophagy in multiple ways. EV-D68 proteases cleave a major autophagic cargo adaptor and the autophagic SNARE SNAP29, which reportedly regulates fusion between autophagosome to amphisome/autolysosome. Although the virus inhibits autophagic degradation, SNAP29 promotes virus replication early in infection. An orphan SNARE, SNAP47, is shown to have a previously unknown role in autophagy, and SNAP47 promotes the replication of EV-D68. Our study illuminates a~mechanism for subversion of autophagic flux and redirection of the autophagic membranes to benefit EV-D68 replication.},

  abstract = {Localization of a membrane protein in a subcellular compartment can be achieved by its retention in the compartment or by its continuous transport toward this compartment. Previous results have suggested that specific enzymes are localized in the Golgi apparatus at least in part by selective retention and exclusion from transport vesicles. However, the function of some Golgi SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) proteins is not compatible with their exclusion from transport vesicles. To help understand the mechanism accounting for the localization of SNARE proteins in the Golgi apparatus, we analyzed their lateral distribution in the Golgi cisternae and their incorporation into transport vesicles. According to our results, all SNARE proteins are efficiently incorporated into transport vesicles, indicating that the localization of SNARE proteins in the Golgi apparatus is not based on a static retention mechanism. Detailed analysis suggested that incorporation into transport vesicles was more efficient for SNARE proteins restricted to the cis face of the Golgi as compared with SNAREs present at the trans face. Furthermore, overexpression of a cis-Golgi SNARE protein altered concomitantly its incorporation in transport vesicles and its intra-Golgi localization. These observations suggest that, contrary to resident Golgi enzymes, SNARE proteins are localized in the Golgi apparatus as the result of a dynamic transport equilibrium.},

We cover the well understood vesicle formation process orchestrated by the COPI coat, and the comprehensively documented fusion process governed by a set of Golgi localised SNAREs. Much less clear are the steps in-between formation and fusion of vesicles, and we therefore provide a much needed update of the latest findings about vesicle tethering.

We have previously shown that Retro-2, a member of a novel class of small retrograde pathway inhibitors caused reduced LPV sizes and lower parasite numbers during experimental L. mexicana sp. infections. The purpose of this study was to determine if structural analogs of Retro-2cycl reported to have superior potency in the inhibition of retrograde pathway-dependent phenomena (i.e., polyomavirus cellular infection by polyomavrius and Shiga toxin trafficking in cells) are also more effective than the parent compound at controlling Leishmania infections. In addition to their effects on LPV development, we show that two optimized analogs of Retro-2cycl, DHQZ 36 and DHQZ 36.1 limit Leishmania amazonensis infection in macrophages at EC50 of 13.63+/-2.58{$\mu$}M and10.57+/-2.66{$\mu$}M, respectively, which is significantly lower than 40.15{$\mu$}M the EC50 of Retro-2cycl. In addition, these analogs caused a reversal in Leishmania induced suppression of IL-6 release by infected cells after LPS activation. Moreover, we show that in contrast to Retro-2cycl that is Leishmania static, the analogs can kill Leishmania parasites in axenic cultures, which is a desirable attribute for any drug to treat Leishmania infections. Together, these studies validate and extend the published structure-activity relationship analyses of Retro-2cycl.},

  abstract = {Formation of the cytoplasmic viral assembly compartment (cVAC) is an important step for efficient human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) assembly. To do this, the virus must alter and repurpose the normal cellular balance of membrane and protein flux, a process that is not well understood. Although a recent screen identified three viral proteins essential for cVAC formation, less is known about the contribution of cellular factors. We show that HCMV infection increases the protein level of a cellular trafficking factor, syntaxin 5 (STX5), a member of the syntaxin family of SNARE proteins. STX5 is recruited to the cVAC in infected cells and is required for the efficient production of infectious virions. We find that STX5 is important for normal cVAC morphology and the proper localization of viral proteins. A previously identified inhibitor of trafficking, Retro94, causes the mislocalization of STX5, an altered cVAC morphology, and dispersal of viral proteins. The presence of Retro94 results in severely impaired production of infectious virions, with a decrease as great as 5 logs. We show that this inhibition is conserved among different strains of HCMV and the various cell types that support infection, as well as for murine CMV. Thus, our data identify a key cellular trafficking factor important for supporting HCMV infection. IMPORTANCE Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection causes severe disease and mortality in immunocompromised individuals, including organ transplant and AIDS patients. In addition, infection of a developing fetus may result in lifelong complications such as deafness and learning disabilities. Understanding in detail the processes involved in HCMV replication is important for developing novel treatments. One of these essential processes, assembly of infectious virions, takes places in the cytoplasmic viral assembly compartment. We identify a cellular protein, syntaxin 5, important for generating this compartment, and show that it is required for the efficient production of infectious virions. We also show that a small molecule that disrupts this protein also significantly reduces the amount of infectious virions that are generated. Thus, by pinpointing a cellular protein that is important in the replication cycle of HCMV, we identified a novel target that can be pursued for therapeutic intervention.},

This uncertainty arises from limited knowledge of the total number of distinct glycans and glycan structures in the human glycome, as well as limited information about the glycan determinants recognized by glycan-binding proteins (GBPs), which include lectins, receptors, toxins, microbial adhesins, antibodies, and enzymes. Available evidence indicates that GBP binding sites may accommodate glycan determinants made up of 2 to 6 linear monosaccharides, together with their potential side chains containing other sugars and modifications, such as sulfation, phosphorylation, and acetylation. Glycosaminoglycans, including heparin and heparan sulfate, comprise repeating disaccharide motifs, where a linear sequence of 5 to 6 monosaccharides may be required for recognition. Based on our current knowledge of the composition of the glycome and the size of GBP binding sites, glycoproteins and glycolipids may contain {$\sim$}3000 glycan determinants with an additional {$\sim$}4000 theoretical pentasaccharide sequences in glycosaminoglycans. These numbers provide an achievable target for new chemical and/or enzymatic syntheses, and raise new challenges for defining the total glycome and the determinants recognized by GBPs.},

In a recent work we used a fluorescent derivative of NRB (NRB-AF12), obtained by coupling the NBD fluorophore to the parent molecule via a linker, in order to gain information about the possible site of action of the unlabelled compound. We found that NRB-AF12 labelled intracellular organelles in both NRB-sensitive and -insensitive cells and we accordingly proposed its use as a scaffold for the development of a new class of fluorescent probes. In this study, we examined the fluorescent properties of a BODIPY FL-conjugated NRB probe (MC009) developed: A) to verify if NRB distribution could be influenced by the attached fluorophore; B) to improve the fluorescent performance of NRB-AF12. Methods. MC009 characteristics were investigated by confocal fluorescence microscopy, in freshly isolated rat caudal artery myocytes (FIRCAM) and in LX2 cells, representative of NRB-sensitive and insensitive cells, respectively. Main results. In both FIRCAM and LX2 cells MC009 stained endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, Golgi apparatus and lipid droplets, revealing the same intracellular distribution as NRB-AF12, and, at the same time, had both improved photostability and gave a more intense fluorescent signal at lower concentrations than was possible with NRB-AF12, which resulted in a better and finer visualization of intracellular structures. Furthermore, MC009 was effective in cellular labelling in both living and fixed cells. At the concentration used to stain the cells, MC009 did not show any cytotoxic effect and did not affect the regular progression of cell cycle and division. Conclusions. This study demonstrates that the distribution of fluorescently labelled NRB is not affected by the type of fluorophore attached to the parent compound, supporting the idea that the localization of the fluorescent derivatives may reasonably reflect that of the parent compound. In addition, we observed a marked improvement in the fluorescent properties of BODIPY FL-conjugated NRB (MC009) over its NBD-derived counterpart (NRB-AF12), confirming NRB as a scaffold for the development of new, high performance, non-toxic fluorescent probes for the labelling of intracellular structures in both living and fixed cells.},

The most distant member of the family, syntaxin 5, has been found in the Golgi region and has significant homology (35\% identity) with Sed5p, an essential protein in yeast which is required for vesicular transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi stack. Here we present evidence that syntaxin 5 performs an analogous function in ER to Golgi transport in mammalian cells. Transient expression of an hemagglutinin-tagged full-length clone of syntaxin 5 and a truncated mutant lacking the transmembrane domain inhibited the transport of vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein to the Golgi stack. Under these conditions, vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein accumulated in pre-Golgi intermediates, which were strongly enriched in syntaxin 5. Our results suggest that syntaxin 5 is the functional mammalian homologue of Sed5p and provides evidence for its role in regulating the potential targeting and/or fusion of carrier vesicles following export from the ER.},

Cells lacking Pkr1p show reduced levels of the V-ATPase subunit Vph1p due to increased turnover of the protein in mutant cells. Reduced levels of the V-ATPase lead to defective copper loading of Fet3p, a component of the high affinity iron transport system. Levels of Vph1p in cells lacking Pkr1p are similar to cells unable to assemble a functional V-ATPase due to lack of a V0 subunit or an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) assembly factor. However, unlike yeast mutants lacking a V0 subunit or a V-ATPase assembly factor, low levels of Vph1p present in cells lacking Pkr1p are assembled into a V-ATPase complex, which exits the ER and is present on the vacuolar membrane. The V-ATPase assembled in the absence of Pkr1p is fully functional because the mutant cells are able to weakly acidify their vacuoles. Finally, overexpression of the V-ATPase assembly factor Vma21p suppresses the growth and acidification defects of pkr1Delta cells. Our data indicate that Pkr1p functions together with the other V-ATPase assembly factors in the ER to efficiently assemble the V-ATPase membrane sector.},

We conclude with a discussion of the coordination and the interdependence of these four regulatory layers.},

  abstract = {Parkinson disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder pathologically characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons from the substantia nigra pars compacta and the presence, in affected brain regions, of protein inclusions named Lewy bodies (LBs). The ATP13A2 gene (locus PARK9) encodes the protein ATP13A2, a lysosomal type 5 P-type ATPase that is linked to autosomal recessive familial parkinsonism. The physiological function of ATP13A2, and hence its role in PD, remains to be elucidated. Here, we show that PD-linked mutations in ATP13A2 lead to several lysosomal alterations in ATP13A2 PD patient-derived fibroblasts, including impaired lysosomal acidification, decreased proteolytic processing of lysosomal enzymes, reduced degradation of lysosomal substrates, and diminished lysosomal-mediated clearance of autophagosomes. Similar alterations are observed in stable ATP13A2-knockdown dopaminergic cell lines, which are associated with cell death. Restoration of ATP13A2 levels in ATP13A2-mutant/depleted cells restores lysosomal function and attenuates cell death. Relevant to PD, ATP13A2 levels are decreased in dopaminergic nigral neurons from patients with PD, in which ATP13A2 mostly accumulates within Lewy bodies. Our results unravel an instrumental role of ATP13A2 deficiency on lysosomal function and cell viability and demonstrate the feasibility and therapeutic potential of modulating ATP13A2 levels in the context of PD.},

For this reason, light microscopy has often been used, initially for localization of Golgi glycotransferases and, more recently, for other Golgi proteins (e.g., Arf1, GBF1, Rab6). Quantitation of light microscopic intra-Golgi localization can be problematic. We describe here a novel quantitative light microscopic methodology using linescans crossing the Golgi ribbon. Our method determines a localization for the unknown protein in a one-dimensional coordinate system in which 0.0 corresponds to localization of a cis marker and 1.0 to localization of a trans marker. We also describe a variant of this methodology in which Golgi morphology is simplified by nocodazole-induced dispersal into ministacks, allowing a fully automated analysis. In our assay, beta1,4-galactosyltransferase-YFP and Golgin97 localize similarly to trans markers, whereas p115, GBF1, and p58-YFP are similarly near other cis markers. The medial Golgi protein alpha1,3-1,6-mannosidase II gives an intermediate localization in this assay. These methodologies may prove useful in instances where electron microscopy is technically difficult as well as when rapid analysis of large numbers of samples is required.},

Transmembrane protein 165 (TMEM165) belongs to an uncharacterized family of membrane proteins called Uncharacterized Protein Family 0016, which are well conserved throughout evolution and share characteristics reminiscent of the cation/Ca(2+) exchanger superfamily. Gcr1 dependent translation factor 1 (Gdt1p), the budding yeast member of this family, contributes to Ca(2+) homeostasis via an uncharacterized Ca(2+) transport pathway localized in the Golgi apparatus. The gdt1{$\Delta$} mutant was found to be sensitive to high concentrations of Ca(2+), and interestingly, this sensitivity was suppressed by expression of TMEM165, the human ortholog of Gdt1p, indicating conservation of function among the members of this family. Patch-clamp analyses on human cells indicated that TMEM165 expression is linked to Ca(2+) ion transport. Furthermore, defects in TMEM165 affected both Ca(2+) and pH homeostasis. Based on these results, we propose that Gdt1p and TMEM165 could be members of a unique family of Golgi-localized Ca(2+)/H(+) antiporters and that modification of the Golgi Ca(2+) and pH balance could explain the glycosylation defects observed in TMEM165-deficient patients.},

Deciphering their precise mode of action has proved challenging. SM proteins are thought to act primarily through one type of SNARE protein, the syntaxins. Despite high structural similarity, however, contrasting binding modes have been found for different SM proteins and syntaxins. Whereas the secretory SM protein Munc18 binds to the \quotedblbase closed conformation" of syntaxin 1, the ER-Golgi SM protein Sly1 interacts only with the N-peptide of Sed5. Recent findings, however, indicate that SM proteins might interact simultaneously with both syntaxin regions. In search for a common mechanism, we now reinvestigated the Sly1/Sed5 interaction. We found that individual Sed5 adopts a tight closed conformation. Sly1 binds to both the closed conformation and the N-peptide of Sed5, suggesting that this is the original binding mode of SM proteins and syntaxins. In contrast to Munc18, however, Sly1 facilitates SNARE complex formation by loosening the closed conformation of Sed5.},

  abstract = {The association of receptors and solute transporters with components of the endocytic machinery regulates their surface levels, and thereby cellular sensitivity to cytokines, ligands and nutrients in the extracellular environment. Most transmembrane receptors and solute transporters are glycoproteins, and the Asn (N)-linked oligosaccharides (N-glycans) can bind animal lectins, forming multivalent lattices or microdomains that regulate glycoprotein mobility in the plane of membrane. The N-glycan number (sequence-encoded NXS/T) and context-dependent Golgi N-glycan branching cooperate to regulate glycoprotein affinities for the galectin family of lectins. Galectin-3 binding reduces EGF receptor trafficking into clathrin-coated pits and caveolae lipid rafts, decreases ligand-independent receptor activation and promotes {$\alpha$}5{$\beta$}1 integrin remodelling in focal adhesions. N-glycan branching in the medial Golgi increases glycan affinity for galectins, and the Golgi pathway is sensitive to uridine diphosphate-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) supply, in turn hexosamine pathway metabolites (fructose-6-P, glutamine and acetyl-CoA). Thus, lattice avidity and cellular responsiveness to extracellular cues are regulated in an adaptive manner by metabolism and Golgi modification to glycoproteins. Computational modelling of the hexosamine/Golgi/lattice has provided new insight on cell surface adaptation in cancer and autoimmune disease.},

Golgin-84 binds to active rab1 but not cis-Golgi matrix proteins. Overexpression or depletion of golgin-84 results in fragmentation of the Golgi ribbon. Strikingly, the Golgi ribbon is converted into mini-stacks constituting only {$\sim$}25\% of the volume of a normal Golgi apparatus upon golgin-84 depletion. These mini-stacks are able to carry out protein transport, though with reduced efficiency compared with a normal Golgi apparatus. Our results suggest that golgin-84 plays a key role in the assembly and maintenance of the Golgi ribbon in mammalian cells.},

Mechanisms exist to connect tethering with fusion, but in most cases, the details remain poorly understood. GM130 is a member of the golgin family of coiled-coil proteins tat is involved in membrane tethering at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to Golgi intermediate compartment and cis-Golgi. Here, we demonstrate that GM130 interacts with syntaxin 5, a t-SNARE also localized to the early secretory pathway. Binding to syntaxin 5 is specific, direct, and mediated by the membrane-proximal region of GM130. Interestingly, interaction with syntaxin 5 is inhibited by the binding of the vesicle docking protein p115 to a distal binding site in GM130. The interaction between GM130 and the small GTPase Rab1 is also inhibited by p115 binding. Our findings suggest a mechanism for coupling membrane tethering and fusion at the ER to Golgi intermediate compartment and cis-Golgi, with GM130 playing a central role in linking these processes. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that depletion of GM130 by RNA interference slows the rate of ER to Golgi trafficking in vivo. The interactions of GM130 with syntaxin 5 and Rab1 are also regulated by mitotic phosphorylation, which is likely to contribute to the inhibition of ER to Golgi trafficking that occurs when mammalian cells enter mitosis.},

We find that PM PI(4,5)P2 levels are supported by at least two continuously supplying precursor pools of PI(4)P, one in the PM and the other in the Golgi. The contribution of the Golgi pool of PI(4)P highlights the possibility that PM PI(4,5)P2 production is coupled to important cell biological processes.Plasma membrane (PM) phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2] regulates the activity of many ion channels and other membrane-associated proteins. To determine precursor sources of the PM PI(4,5)P2 pool in tsA-201 cells, we monitored KCNQ2/3 channel currents and translocation of PHPLC{$\delta$}1 domains as real-time indicators of PM PI(4,5)P2, and translocation of PHOSH2\texttimes 2, and PHOSH1 domains as indicators of PM and Golgi phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate [PI(4)P], respectively. We selectively depleted PI(4)P pools at the PM, Golgi, or both using the rapamycin-recruitable lipid 4-phosphatases. Depleting PI(4)P at the PM with a recruitable 4-phosphatase (Sac1) results in a decrease of PI(4,5)P2 measured by electrical or optical indicators. Depleting PI(4)P at the Golgi with the 4-phosphatase or disrupting membrane-transporting motors induces a decline in PM PI(4,5)P2. Depleting PI(4)P simultaneously at both the Golgi and the PM induces a larger decrease of PI(4,5)P2. The decline of PI(4,5)P2 following 4-phosphatase recruitment takes 1\textendash 2 min. Recruiting the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) toward the Golgi membranes mimics the effects of depleting PI(4)P at the Golgi, apparently due to the trans actions of endogenous ER Sac1. Thus, maintenance of the PM pool of PI(4,5)P2 appears to depend on precursor pools of PI(4)P both in the PM and in the Golgi. The decrease in PM PI(4,5)P2 when Sac1 is recruited to the Golgi suggests that the Golgi contribution is ongoing and that PI(4,5)P2 production may be coupled to important cell biological processes such as membrane trafficking or lipid transfer activity.},

  abstract = {Rab6, the most abundant Golgi associated small GTPase, consists of 2 equally common isoforms, Rab6A and Rab6A{${'}$}, that differ in 3 amino acids and localize to trans Golgi cisternae. The two isoforms are largely redundant in function and hence are often referred to generically as Rab6. Rab6 loss-of-function inhibits retrograde Golgi trafficking, induces an increase in Golgi cisternal number in HeLa cells and delays the cell surface appearance of the anterograde cargo protein, VSVG. We hypothesized that these effects are linked and might be explained by a cisternal-specific delay in cargo transport. In pulse chase experiments using a deconvolved, confocal line scanning approach to score the distribution of the tsO45 mutant of VSVG protein in Rab6 depleted cells, we found that anterograde transport at 32~\textdegree C, permissive conditions, through the Golgi apparatus was locally delayed, almost tenfold, between medial and trans Golgi cisterna. Cis to medial transport was nearly normal as was trans Golgi to TGN transport. TGN exit was unaffected by Rab6 depletion. These effects were the same with either of two siRNAs. Similar intra-Golgi transport delays were seen at 37~\textdegree C with RUSH VSVG or a RUSH GPI-anchored construct using a biotin pulse to release the marker proteins from the ER. Using 3D-SIM, a super resolution approach, we found that RUSH VSVG transport was delayed pre-trans Golgi. These visual approaches suggest a selective slowing of anterograde transport relative to 3 different marker proteins downstream of the trans Golgi. Using a biochemical approach, we found that the onset of VSVG endoglycosidase H resistance in Rab6 depleted cells was delayed. Depletion of neither Rab6A or Rab6A{${'}$} isoforms alone had any effect on anterograde transport through the Golgi suggesting that Rab6A and Rab6A{${'}$} act coordinately. Delayed cargo transport conditions correlate strongly with a proliferation of Golgi cisternae observed in earlier electron microscopy. Our results strongly indicate that Rab6 is selectively required for rapid anterograde transport from the medial to trans Golgi. We suggest that the observed correlation with localized cisternal proliferation fits best with a cisternal progression model of Golgi function.},

Here we describe a novel yeast protein with a typical SNARE motif but with low overall amino acid homologies to other SNAREs. The protein localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and was therefore named Use1p (unconventional SNARE in the ER). A temperature-sensitive use1 mutant was generated. use1 mutant cells accumulated the ER forms of carboxypeptidase Y and invertase. More specific assays revealed that use1 mutant cells were defective in retrograde traffic to the ER. This was supported by strong genetic interactions between USE1 and the genes encoding SNAREs in retrograde traffic to the ER. Antibodies directed against Use1p co-immunoprecipitated the SNAREs Ufe1p, myc-Sec20p and Sec22p, which form a SNARE complex required for retrograde traffic from the Golgi to the ER, but neither Bos1p nor Bet1p (members of the SNARE complex in anterograde traffic to the Golgi). Therefore, we conclude that Use1p is a novel SNARE protein that functions in retrograde traffic from the Golgi to the ER.},

The goal of this review is to provide an overview of the SNAREs involved in endosomal and phagosomal trafficking. Of the 38 SNAREs present in humans, 30 have been identified at endosomes and/or phagosomes.

NOX2 produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the lumen of the phagosome which kill ingested pathogens, delay antigen breakdown and alter the peptide repertoire for presentation to T cells. How the integral membrane component of NOX2, cytochrome b558, traffics to phagosomes is incompletely understood. In this study, we show in dendritic cells derived from human blood-isolated monocytes that cytochrome b558 is initially recruited to the phagosome from the plasma membrane during phagosome formation. Cytochrome b558 also traffics from a lysosomal pool to phagosomes and this is required to replenish oxidatively damaged NOX2. We identified syntaxin-7, SNAP23 and VAMP8 as the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins mediating this process. Our data describe a key mechanism of how dendritic cells sustain ROS production after antigen uptake required to initiate T cell responses.},

Reliable quantitation of tRNA levels in human samples using microarray methods presents a technical challenge. We have developed a microarray method to quantify tRNAs based on a fluorescent dye-labeling technique. The first-generation tRNA microarray consists of 42 probes for nuclear encoded tRNAs and 21 probes for mitochondrial encoded tRNAs. These probes cover tRNAs for all 20 amino acids and 11 isoacceptor families. Using this array, we report that the amounts of tRNA within the total cellular RNA vary widely among eight different human tissues. The brain expresses higher overall levels of nuclear encoded tRNAs than every tissue examined but one and higher levels of mitochondrial encoded tRNAs than every tissue examined. We found tissue-specific differences in the expression of individual tRNA species, and tRNAs decoding amino acids with similar chemical properties exhibited coordinated expression in distinct tissue types. Relative tRNA abundance exhibits a statistically significant correlation to the codon usage of a collection of highly expressed, tissue-specific genes in a subset of tissues or tRNA isoacceptors. Our findings demonstrate the existence of tissue-specific expression of tRNA species that strongly implicates a role for tRNA heterogeneity in regulating translation and possibly additional processes in vertebrate organisms.},

Two of these were also found in membranes of higher density (corresponding to the ER), and this correlated with their ability to bind COP I in vitro. This binding was mediated by a K(X)KXX-like retrieval motif present in the cytoplasmic domain of these two members. A second motif, double phenylalanine (FF), present in the cytoplasmic domain of all five members, was shown to participate in the binding of Sec23 (COP II). This motif is part of a larger one, similar to the F/YXXXXF/Y strong endocytosis and putative AP2 binding motif. In vivo mutational analysis confirmed the roles of both motifs so that when COP I binding was expected to be impaired, cell surface expression was observed, whereas mutation of the Sec23 binding motif resulted in a redistribution to the ER. Surprisingly, upon expression of mutated members, steady-state distribution of unmutated ones shifted as well, presumably as a consequence of their observed oligomeric properties.},

We have previously demonstrated that the formation of enlarged endo-lysosomal structures (EELSs) is one of the major glycosylation-independent phenotypes of cells depleted for individual COG complex subunits. Here, we characterize the EELSs in HEK293T cells using microscopy and biochemical approaches. Our analysis revealed that the EELSs are highly acidic and that vATPase-dependent acidification is essential for the maintenance of this enlarged compartment. The EELSs are accessible for both trans-Golgi enzymes and endocytic cargo. Moreover, the EELSs specifically accumulate endolysosomal proteins Lamp2, CD63, Rab7, Rab9, Rab39, Vamp7 and STX8 on their surface. The EELSs are distinct from lysosomes and do not accumulate active Cathepsin B. Retention Using Selective Hooks (RUSH) experiments revealed that biosynthetic cargo mCherry-Lamp1 reaches the EELSs much faster as compared to both receptor-mediated and soluble endocytic cargo, indicating TGN origin of the EELSs. In support to this hypothesis, EELSs are enriched with TGN specific lipid PI4P. Additionally, analysis of COG4/VPS54 double KO cells revealed that the activity of the GARP tethering complex is necessary for EELSs' accumulation, indicating that protein mistargeting and the imbalance of Golgi-endosome membrane flow leads to the formation of EELSs in COG-deficient cells. The EELSs are likely to serve as a degradative storage hybrid organelle for mistargeted Golgi enzymes and underglycosylated glycoconjugates. To our knowledge this is the first report of the formation of an enlarged hybrid endosomal compartment in a response to malfunction of the intra-Golgi trafficking machinery.},

In vertebrates, SM proteins that mediate exocytosis (Munc18-1, 18-2, and 18c) bind to the closed conformation of syntaxins 1-4, which requires the N-terminal H(abc) domains and SNARE motifs of these syntaxins. In contrast, SM proteins that mediate Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum fusion (Sly1 and Vps45) bind only to short N-terminal sequences of syntaxins 5, 16, or 18, independently of their H(abc) domains and SNARE motifs. We now show that Munc18-1, Sly1, and Vps45 interact with cognate syntaxins via similar, autonomously folded N-terminal domains, but the syntaxin 5-binding surface of the Sly1 N-terminal domain is opposite to the syntaxin 1-binding surface of the Munc18-1 N-terminal domain. In transfected cells, the N-terminal domain of Sly1 specifically disrupts the structure of the Golgi complex, supporting the notion that the interaction of Sly1 with syntaxin 5 is essential for fusion. These data, together with previous results, suggest that a relatively small N-terminal domain of SM proteins is dedicated to mechanistically distinct interactions with SNAREs, leaving the remaining large parts of SM proteins free to execute their as yet unknown function as effector domains.},

  abstract = {The Golgi is a dynamic organelle whose correct assembly is crucial for cellular homeostasis. Perturbations in Golgi structure are associated with numerous disorders from neurodegeneration to cancer. However, whether and how dispersal of the Golgi apparatus is actively regulated under stress, and the consequences of Golgi dispersal, remain unknown. Here we demonstrate that 26S proteasomes are associated with the cytosolic surface of Golgi membranes to facilitate Golgi Apparatus-Related Degradation (GARD) and degradation of GM130 in response to Golgi stress. The degradation of GM130 is dependent on p97/VCP and 26S proteasomes, and required for Golgi dispersal. Finally, we show that perturbation of Golgi homeostasis induces cell death of multiple myeloma in vitro and in vivo, offering a therapeutic strategy for this malignancy. Taken together, this work reveals a mechanism of Golgi-localized proteasomal degradation, providing a functional link between proteostasis control and Golgi architecture, which may be critical in various secretion-related pathologies.},

This process is not only driven by several soluble NSF attachment protein (SNAP) receptor (SNARE) proteins, which are key players in vesicle transport at the cell surface and intracellular compartments, but is also tightly modulated by cholesterol. Cholesterol-sensitive SNAREs at the cell surface are relatively well characterized, but it is less well understood how altered cholesterol levels in intracellular compartments impact on SNARE localization and function. Recent insights from structural biology, protein chemistry and cell microscopy have suggested that a subset of the SNAREs engaged in exocytic and retrograde pathways dynamically 'sense' cholesterol levels in the Golgi and endosomal membranes. Hence, the transport routes that modulate cellular cholesterol distribution appear to trigger not only a change in the location and functioning of SNAREs at the cell surface but also in endomembranes. In this Commentary, we will discuss how disrupted cholesterol transport through the Golgi and endosomal compartments ultimately controls SNARE-mediated delivery of ECM and integrins to the cell surface and, consequently, cell migration.},

N-Glycosylation was assessed using endoglycosidases, revealing that a2P405L, a4R449H, and a4G820R were fully N-glycosylated. Cycloheximide (CHX) chase assays revealed that a2P405L and a4R449H were unstable relative to wildtype. a4R449H was degraded predominantly in the proteasomal pathway, whereas a2P405L was degraded in both proteasomal and lysosomal pathways. Immunofluorescence studies disclosed retention in the endoplasmic reticulum and defective cell-surface expression of a4R449H and defective Golgi trafficking of a2P405L. Co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed an increase in association of a4R449H with the V0 assembly factor VMA21, and a reduced association with the V1 sector subunit, ATP6V1B1 (B1). For a4G820R, where stability, degradation, and trafficking were relatively unaffected, 3D molecular modeling suggested that the mutation causes dRTA by blocking the proton pathway. This study provides critical information that may assist rational drug design to manage dRTA and cutis laxa.},

Clinically, a subunit isoforms are implicated in diverse diseases; however, little is known about their structure and function. The subunit has conserved, predicted N-glycosylation sites, and the a3 isoform has been directly shown to be N-glycosylated. Here we ask if human a4 (ATP6V0A4) is N-glycosylated at the predicted site, Asn489. We transfected HEK 293 cells, using the pCDNA3.1 expression-vector system, to express cDNA constructs of epitope-tagged human a4 subunit, with or without mutations to eliminate the putative glycosylation site. Glycosylation was characterized also by treatment with endoglycosidases; expression and localization were assessed by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence. Endoglycosidase-treated wild type (WT) a4 showed increased relative mobility on immunoblots, compared with untreated WT a4. This relative mobility was identical to that of unglycosylated mutant a4N489D , demonstrating that the a4 subunit is glycosylated. Cycloheximide pulse-chase experiments showed that the unglycosylated subunit degraded at a higher rate than the N-glycosylated form. Unglycosylated a4 was degraded mostly in the proteasomal pathway, but also, in part, through the lysosomal pathway. Immunofluorescence colocalization data showed that unglycosylated a4 was mostly retained in the ER, and that plasma membrane trafficking was defective. Co-immunoprecipitation studies suggested that a4N489D does not assemble with the V-ATPase V1 domain.

They are encoded by four conserved paralogous genes, and their vertebrate orthologs have positionally conserved N-glycosylation sequons within the second extracellular loop, EL2, of the a subunit membrane domain. Previously, we have shown directly that the predicted sequon for the a4 isoform is indeed N-glycosylated. Here we extend our investigation to the other isoforms by transiently transfecting HEK 293 cells to express cDNA constructs of epitope-tagged human a1-a3 subunits, with or without mutations that convert Asn to Gln at putative N-glycosylation sites. Expression and N-glycosylation were characterized by immunoblotting and mobility shifts after enzymatic deglycosylation, and intracellular localization was determined using immunofluorescence microscopy. All unglycosylated mutants, where predicted N-glycosylation sites had been eliminated by sequon mutagenesis, showed increased relative mobility on immunoblots, identical to what was seen for wild-type a subunits after enzymatic deglycosylation. Cycloheximide-chase experiments showed that unglycosylated subunits were turned over at a higher rate than N-glycosylated forms by degradation in the proteasomal pathway. Immunofluorescence colocalization analysis showed that unglycosylated a subunits were retained in the ER, and co-immunoprecipitation studies showed that they were unable to associate with the V-ATPase assembly chaperone, VMA21. Taken together with our previous a4 subunit studies, these observations show that N-glycosylation is crucial in all four human V-ATPase a subunit isoforms for protein stability and ultimately for functional incorporation into V-ATPase complexes.},

We have previously reported abnormal distribution of these organelles \textendash{} as judged by reduced percentages of cells displaying pronounced perinuclear accumulation \textendash{} in mutant fibroblasts lacking BLOC-3 (for `biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex 3'). BLOC-3 is a protein complex that contains the products of the genes mutated in Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome types 1 and 4. Here, we developed a method based on image analysis to estimate the extent of organelle clustering in the perinuclear region of cultured cells. Using this method, we corroborated that the perinuclear clustering of late endocytic organelles containing Lamp1 (for `lysosome-associated membrane protein 1') is reduced in BLOC-3-deficient murine fibroblasts, and found that it is apparently normal in fibroblasts deficient in BLOC-1 or BLOC-2, which are another two protein complexes associated with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome. Wild-type and mutant fibroblasts were transfected to express human LAMP1 fused at its cytoplasmic tail to green fluorescence protein (GFP). At low expression levels, LAMP1-GFP was targeted correctly to late endocytic organelles in both wild-type and mutant cells. High levels of LAMP1-GFP overexpression elicited aberrant aggregation of late endocytic organelles, a phenomenon that probably involved formation of anti-parallel dimers of LAMP1-GFP as it was not observed in cells expressing comparable levels of a non-dimerizing mutant variant, LAMP1-mGFP. To test whether BLOC-3 plays a role in the movement of late endocytic organelles, time-lapse fluorescence microscopy experiments were performed using live cells expressing low levels of LAMP1-GFP or LAMP1-mGFP. Although active movement of late endocytic organelles was observed in both wild-type and mutant fibroblasts, quantitative analyses revealed a relatively lower frequency of microtubule-dependent movement events, either towards or away from the perinuclear region, within BLOC-3-deficient cells. By contrast, neither the duration nor the speed of these microtubule-dependent events seemed to be affected by the lack of BLOC-3 function. These results suggest that BLOC-3 function is required, directly or indirectly, for optimal attachment of late endocytic organelles to microtubule-dependent motors.},

Consequently, to adapt to the surrounding environment and the different intracellular contexts, the secretory pathway needs to accommodate and respond to a plethora of endogenous and exogenous stimuli. It is now well established that several kinases, known to be activated by environmental stimuli, signal from the plasma membrane to the secretory pathway in order to remodel its architecture and modulate the cellular secretion capacity. By contrast, membranes of the early secretory pathway, similar to the endosomal system, can also initiate and modulate signalling cascades, thereby spatially organising cellular signalling and eliciting a different cellular outcome than when signalling is localised to the plasma membrane. This Commentary highlights recent contributions to our understanding of the mutual regulation of the secretory pathway and cellular signalling.},

V-ATPases consist of two functionally and structurally distinct domains, V1 and V0. The peripheral cytoplasmically oriented V1 domain drives ATP hydrolysis, which necessitates the translocation of protons across the integral membrane bound V0 domain. Here, we demonstrate that an accessory subunit, Ac45, interacts with the V0 domain and contributes to the vacuolar type proton pump-mediated function in osteoclasts. Consistent with its role in intracellular acidification, Ac45 was found to be localized to the ruffled border region of polarized resorbing osteoclasts and enriched in pH-dependent endosomal compartments that polarized to the ruffled border region of actively resorbing osteoclasts. Interestingly, truncation of the 26-amino acid residue cytoplasmic tail of Ac45, which encodes an autonomous internalization signal, was found to impair bone resorption in vitro. Furthermore, biochemical analysis revealed that although both wild type Ac45 and mutant were capable of associating with subunits a3, c, c{${''}$}, and d, deletion of the cytoplasmic tail altered its binding proximity with a3, c{${''}$}, and d. In all, our data suggest that the cytoplasmic terminus of Ac45 contains elements necessary for its proper interaction with V0 domain and efficient osteoclastic bone resorption.},

The STtyr isoform is transiently localized in the Golgi and is ultimately cleaved and secreted, whereas the STcys isoform is stably localized in the Golgi and is not cleaved and secreted. The stable localization of STcys is correlated with its enhanced ability to oligomerize. To test the hypothesis that multiple signals can mediate Golgi localization and further evaluate the role of oligomerization in the localization process, we evaluated the effects of individually and simultaneously altering the cytosolic tail and transmembrane region of the STcys isoform. We found that the localization, processing, and oligomerization of STcys were not substantially changed when either the core amino acids of the cytosolic tail were deleted or the sequence and length of the transmembrane region were altered. In contrast, when these changes were made simultaneously, the STcys isoform was converted into a form that was processed, secreted, and weakly oligomerized like STtyr. We propose that STcys oligomerization is a secondary event resulting from its concentration in the Golgi via mechanisms independently mediated by its cytosolic tail and transmembrane region.},

  abstract = {Mitochondria are key organelles for cellular metabolism, and regulate several processes including cell death and macroautophagy/autophagy. Here, we show that mitochondrial respiratory chain (RC) deficiency deactivates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK, a key regulator of energy homeostasis) signaling in tissue and in cultured cells. The deactivation of AMPK in RC-deficiency is due to increased expression of the AMPK-inhibiting protein FLCN (folliculin). AMPK is found to be necessary for basal lysosomal function, and AMPK deactivation in RC-deficiency inhibits lysosomal function by decreasing the activity of the lysosomal Ca2+ channel MCOLN1 (mucolipin 1). MCOLN1 is regulated by phosphoinositide kinase PIKFYVE and its product PtdIns(3,5)P2, which is also decreased in RC-deficiency. Notably, reactivation of AMPK, in a PIKFYVE-dependent manner, or of MCOLN1 in RC-deficient cells, restores lysosomal hydrolytic capacity. Building on these data and the literature, we propose that downregulation of the AMPK-PIKFYVE-PtdIns(3,5)P2-MCOLN1 pathway causes lysosomal Ca2+ accumulation and impaired lysosomal catabolism. Besides unveiling a novel role of AMPK in lysosomal function, this study points to the mechanism that links mitochondrial malfunction to impaired lysosomal catabolism, underscoring the importance of AMPK and the complexity of organelle cross-talk in the regulation of cellular homeostasis.Abbreviation: {$\Delta\Psi$}m: mitochondrial transmembrane potential; AMP: adenosine monophosphate; AMPK: AMP-activated protein kinase; ATG5: autophagy related 5; ATP: adenosine triphosphate; ATP6V0A1: ATPase, H+ transporting, lysosomal, V0 subbunit A1; ATP6V1A: ATPase, H+ transporting, lysosomal, V0 subbunit A; BSA: bovine serum albumin; CCCP: carbonyl cyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazone; CREB1: cAMP response element binding protein 1; CTSD: cathepsin D; CTSF: cathepsin F; DMEM: Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; DMSO: dimethyl sulfoxide; EBSS: Earl's balanced salt solution; ER: endoplasmic reticulum; FBS: fetal bovine serum; FCCP: carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenolhydrazone; GFP: green fluorescent protein; GPN: glycyl-L-phenylalanine 2-naphthylamide; LAMP1: lysosomal associated membrane protein 1; MAP1LC3B/LC3B: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta; MCOLN1/TRPML1: mucolipin 1; MEF: mouse embryonic fibroblast; MITF: melanocyte inducing transcription factor; ML1N*2-GFP: probe used to detect PtdIns(3,5)P2 based on the transmembrane domain of MCOLN1; MTORC1: mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase complex 1; NDUFS4: NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit S4; OCR: oxygen consumption rate; PBS: phosphate-buffered saline; pcDNA: plasmid cytomegalovirus promoter DNA; PCR: polymerase chain reaction; PtdIns3P: phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate; PtdIns(3,5)P2: phosphatidylinositol-3,5-bisphosphate; PIKFYVE: phosphoinositide kinase, FYVE-type zinc finger containing; P/S: penicillin-streptomycin; PVDF: polyvinylidene fluoride; qPCR: quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction; RFP: red fluorescent protein; RNA: ribonucleic acid; SDS-PAGE: sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; shRNA: short hairpin RNA; siRNA: small interfering RNA; TFEB: transcription factor EB; TFE3: transcription factor binding to IGHM enhancer 3; TMRM: tetramethylrhodamine, methyl ester, perchlorate; ULK1: unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1; ULK2: unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 2; UQCRC1: ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase core protein 1; v-ATPase: vacuolar-type H+-translocating ATPase; WT: wild-type},

The structure of glycans that decorate proteins and lipids is largely dictated by biosynthetic reactions occurring in the Golgi apparatus. This biosynthesis relies on the relative distribution of glycosyltransferases and glycosidases, which is maintained by retrograde vesicle traffic between Golgi cisternae. Tethering of vesicles at the Golgi apparatus prior to fusion is regulated by Rab GTPases, coiled-coil tethers termed golgins and the multisubunit tethering complex known as the conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex. In this review we discuss the mechanisms involved in vesicle tethering at the Golgi apparatus and highlight the importance of tethering in the context of glycan biosynthesis and a set of diseases known as congenital disorders of glycosylation.},

Here, we describe a patient with a mild form of congenital disorder of glycosylation type II (CDG-II) that is caused by a deficiency in the Cog1 subunit of the complex. This patient has a defect in both N- and O-glycosylation. Mass spectrometric analysis of the structures of the N-linked glycans released from glycoproteins from the patient's serum revealed a reduction in sialic acid and galactose residues. Peanut agglutinin (PNA) lectin staining revealed a decrease in sialic acids on core 1 mucin type O-glycans, indicating a combined defect in N- and O-glycosylation. Sequence analysis of the COG1 cDNA and gene identified a homozygous insertion of a single nucleotide (2659\textendash 2660insC), which is predicted to lead to a premature translation stop and truncation of the C terminus of the Cog1 protein by 80 amino acids. This mutation destabilizes several other COG subunits and alters their subcellular localization and hence the overall integrity of the COG complex. This results in reduced levels and/or altered Golgi localization of {$\alpha$}-mannosidase II and {$\beta$}-1,4 galactosyltransferase I, which links it to the glycosylation deficiency. Transfection of primary fibroblasts of this patient with the full length hemagglutinin-tagged Cog1 indeed restored {$\beta$}-1,4 galactosyltransferase Golgi localization. We propose naming this disorder CDG-II/Cog1, or CDG-II caused by Cog1 deficiency.},

The affected individuals are homozygous for a deep intronic splice mutation in TMEM165. In our cohort of unsolved CDG-II cases, we found another individual with the same mutation and two unrelated individuals with missense mutations in TMEM165.

Dozens of human glycosylation disorders fit these categories. Many other genes, with or without familiar names, well-annotated pedigrees, or likely homologies will join the ranks of glycosylation disorders. Their broad and unpredictable case-by-case phenotypes cross the traditional medical specialty boundaries. The gene functions in patients may be elusive, but their common feature may include altered glycosylation that provide clues to Golgi function.

Established biosynthetic pathways provide many candidate genes, but finding unanticipated mutated genes will offer new insights into glycosylation. Simple glycobiomarkers can be used in narrowing the candidates identified by exome and genome sequencing, and those can be validated by glycosylation analysis of serum or cells from affected individuals. Model organisms will expand the understanding of these mutations' impact on glycosylation and pathology. Here, we highlight some recently discovered glycosylation disorders and the barriers, breakthroughs, and surprises they presented. We predict that some glycosylation disorders might occur with greater frequency than current estimates of their prevalence.

Decrease in SNAP29 expression was found to result in abnormal lamellar granule maturation leading to aberrant epidermal differentiation and ichthyosis. Objectives To delineate the molecular consequences of disease-causing mutations in SNAP29. Methods We used direct sequencing, in vitro mutagenesis and three-dimensional organotypic cell cultures. Results We identified a novel homozygous insertion in SNAP29 (c.486insA) in two sibs presenting with ichthyosis and dysgenesis of the corpus callosum. In vitro transfection experiments indicated that this mutation results in SNAP29 loss-of-function. Further substantiating this notion, we could replicate histological features typical for CEDNIK syndrome in three-dimensional primary human keratinocyte organotypic cell cultures downregulated for SNAP29. Conclusions The identification of a second mutation in SNAP29 in the present study definitely establishes a causal relationship between defective function of SNAP29 and the pleiotropic manifestations of CEDNIK syndrome. Our present and previous data position SNAP29 as an essential component of the epidermal differentiation machinery.},

Whereas most SNAREs are bona fide type II membrane proteins, Ykt6 lacks a proteinaceous membrane anchor but contains a prenylation consensus motif (CAAX box) and exists in an inactive cytosolic and an active membrane-bound form. We demonstrate that both forms are farnesylated at the carboxyl-terminal cysteine of the CCAIM sequence. Farnesylation is the prerequisite for subsequent palmitoylation of the upstream cysteine, which permits stable membrane association of Ykt6. The double-lipid modification and membrane association is crucial for intra-Golgi transport in vitro and cell homeostasis/survival in vivo. The membrane recruitment and palmitoylation is controlled by the N-terminal domain of Ykt6, which interacts with the SNARE motif, keeping it in an inactive closed conformation. Together, these results suggest that conformational changes control the lipid modification and function of Ykt6. Considering the essential and central role of Ykt6 in the secretory pathway, this spatial and functional cycle might provide a mechanism to regulate the rate of intracellular membrane flow.},

Here we tested three potential mechanisms, including vesicle recycling between the Golgi and the endoplasmic reticulum, partitioning in Golgi lipid microdomains, and selective intra-Golgi retention. Recycling rates showed a linear relationship with intra-Golgi mobility of SNAREs. The cis-Golgi SNAREs had higher mobility than intra-Golgi SNAREs, whereas vesicle SNAREs had higher mobility than target membrane SNAREs. The differences in SNARE mobility were not due to preferential partitioning into detergent-resistant membrane microdomains. We propose that intra-Golgi retention precludes entropy-driven redistribution of SNAREs to the endoplasmic reticulum and endocytic compartments.},

  abstract = {Secretion is a fundamental biological activity of all eukaryotic cells by which they release certain substances in the extracellular space. It is considered a specialized mode of membrane trafficking that is achieved by docking and fusion of secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane (i.e., exocytosis). Secretory vesicle traffic is thought to be regulated by a family of Rab small GTPases, which are regulators of membrane traffic that are common to all eukaryotic cells. Classically, mammalian Rab3 subfamily members were thought to be critical regulators of secretory vesicle exocytosis in neurons and endocrine cells, but recent genetic and proteomic studies indicate that Rab3 is not the sole Rab isoform that regulates secretory vesicle traffic. Rather, additional Rab isoforms, especially Rab27 subfamily members, are required for this process. In this article I review the current literature on the function of Rab isoforms and their effectors in regulated secretory vesicle traffic.},

We examined the relocation of the KDEL receptor after treatment with the fungal metabolite brefeldin A and compared this with the retrograde transport of the KDEL receptor observed after ligand or receptor overexpression. Incubation with brefeldin A led to the formation of vesicular structures containing the KDEL receptor and ERGIC-53, a marker for the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed that these structures are composed of tubulo-vesicular clusters. The brefeldin A induced vesicular structures were morphologically and biochemically distinct from the ER-Golgi hybrid compartment as demonstrated by double immunofluorescence microscopy and subcellular fractionation. Overexpression of the receptor itself or a lysozyme-KDEL construct led to a shift of the KDEL receptor together with ERGIC-53, an intermediate compartment marker to the ER but not to structures resembling BFA induced vesicular structures. Moreover, overexpression of the receptor resulted in the partial redistribution of marker proteins of the medial Golgi and the trans-Golgi network to ER-like structures. We conclude that the effects of brefeldin A on the redistribution of the KDEL receptor do not reflect physiological events occurring during increased occupancy of the receptor with ligands. \textcopyright 1997 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.},

Here, we studied 14 purified full-length SNAREs that function in yeast endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi, intra-Golgi, endosomal and vacuolar transport by comprehensively testing cis-QabcR-SNARE assembly and fusogenicity of reconstituted SNARE proteoliposomes. Strikingly, the cognate ER-Golgi and intra-Golgi SNARE-complex assemblies were highly stringent, whereas endosomal and vacuolar SNAREs assembled rather promiscuously into the non-cognate mixed complexes. However, these patterns of cis-SNARE assemblies cannot solely explain their potency to be fusogenic via trans-SNARE pairing: Only the vacuolar 3Q-SNARE combination is fusogenic in the absence of additional components; endosomal SNARE-dependent fusogenicity requires membrane-tethering factors; and ER-Golgi SNAREs can be fusogenic by synergistic actions of tethering factors and the cognate Sec1/Munc18-family protein Sly1p. Thus, our findings uncover multiple and distinct strategies of SNAREs to directly mediate fusion specificity.},

  abstract = {The Golgi apparatus is the main glycosylation and sorting station along the secretory pathway. Its structure includes the Golgi vesicles, which are depleted of anterograde cargo, and also of at least some Golgi-resident proteins. The role of Golgi vesicles remains unclear. Here, we show that Golgi vesicles are enriched in the Qb-SNAREs GS27 (membrin) and GS28 (GOS-28), and depleted of nucleotide sugar transporters. A block of intra-Golgi transport leads to accumulation of Golgi vesicles and partitioning of GS27 and GS28 into these vesicles. Conversely, active intra-Golgi transport induces fusion of these vesicles with the Golgi cisternae, delivering GS27 and GS28 to these cisternae. In an in vitro assay based on a donor compartment that lacks UDP-galactose translocase (a sugar transporter), the segregation of Golgi vesicles from isolated Golgi membranes inhibits intra-Golgi transport; re-addition of isolated Golgi vesicles devoid of UDP-galactose translocase obtained from normal cells restores intra-Golgi transport. We conclude that this activity is due to the presence of GS27 and GS28 in the Golgi vesicles, rather than the sugar transporter. Furthermore, there is an inverse correlation between the number of Golgi vesicles and the number of inter-cisternal connections under different experimental conditions. Finally, a rapid block of the formation of vesicles via COPI through degradation of ?COP accelerates the cis-to-trans delivery of VSVG. These data suggest that Golgi vesicles, presumably with COPI, serve to inhibit intra-Golgi transport by the extraction of GS27 and GS28 from the Golgi cisternae, which blocks the formation of inter-cisternal connections.},

Their profile necessarily needs to be responsive to internal and external factors in a highly dynamic manner. The structural features of the signals must meet the criterion of high-density information coding in a minimum of space. Thus, only biomolecules that can generate many different oligomers (`words') from few building blocks (`letters') qualify to meet this challenge. Examining the respective properties of common biocompounds that form natural oligo- and polymers comparatively, starting with nucleotides and amino acids (the first and second alphabets of life), comes up with sugars as clear frontrunner. The enzymatic machinery for the biosynthesis of sugar chains can indeed link monosaccharides, the letters of the third alphabet of life, in a manner to reach an unsurpassed number of oligomers (complex carbohydrates or glycans). Fittingly, the resulting glycome of a cell can be likened to a fingerprint. Conjugates of glycans with proteins and sphingolipids (glycoproteins and glycolipids) are ubiquitous in Nature. This implies a broad (patho)physiologic significance. By looking at the signals, at the writers and the erasers of this information as well as its readers and ensuing consequences, this review intends to introduce a broad readership to the principles of the concept of the sugar code.},

Systematic RNA interference (RNAi)-based depletion of 58 Rab GTPase proteins and 12 Rab accessory proteins of the PRAF, YIPF and YIF protein families revealed that nine of these were strong regulators.

Our approach therefore provides a novel and robust strategy for a more complete investigation of the molecular components required to regulate Golgi-to-ER transport in mammalian cells.},

  abstract = {The effect of ammonium on the glycosylation pattern of the recombinant immunoadhesin tumor necrosis factor\textendash IgG (TNFR-IgG) produced by Chinese hamster ovary cells is elucidated in this study. TNFR-IgG is a chimeric IgG fusion protein bearing one N-linked glycosylation site in the Fc region and three complex-type N-glycans in the TNF-receptor portion of each monomer. The ammonium concentration of batch suspension cultures was adjusted with glutamine and/or NH4Cl. The amount of galactose (Gal) and N-acetylneuraminic acid (NANA) residues on TNFR-IgG correlated in a dose-dependent manner with the ammonium concentration under which the N-linked oligosaccharides were synthesized. As ammonium increased from 1 to 15 mM, a concomitant decrease of up to 40\% was observed in terminal galactosylation and sialylation of the molecule. Cell culture supernatants contained measurable {$\beta$}-galactosidase and sialidase activity, which increased throughout the culture. The {$\beta$}-galactosidase, but not the sialidase, level was proportional to the ammonium concentration. No loss of N-glycans was observed in incubation studies using {$\beta$}-galactosidase and sialidase containing cell culture supernatants, suggesting that the ammonium effect was biosynthetic and not degradative. Several biosynthetic mechanisms were investigated. Ammonium (a weak base) is known to affect the pH of acidic intracellular compartments (e.g., trans-Golgi) as well as intracellular nucleotide sugar pools (increases UDP-N-acetylglucosamine and UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine). Ammonium might also affect the expression rates of {$\beta$}1,4-galactosyltransferase ({$\beta$}1,4-GT) and {$\alpha$}2,3-sialyltransferase ({$\alpha$}2,3-ST). To separate these mechanisms, experiments were designed using chloroquine (changes intracellular pH) and glucosamine (increases UDP-GNAc pool [sum of UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GalNAc]). The ammonium effect on TNFR-IgG oligosaccharide structures could be mimicked only by chloroquine, another weak base. No differences in N-glycosylation were found in the product synthesized in the presence of glucosamine. No differences in {$\beta$}1,4-galactosyltransferase ({$\beta$}1,4-GT) and {$\alpha$}2,3-sialyltransferase ({$\alpha$}2,3-ST) messenger RNA (mRNA) and enzyme levels were observed in cells cultivated in the presence or absence of 13 mM NH4Cl. pH titration of endogenous CHO {$\alpha$}2,3-ST and {$\beta$}-1,4-GT revealed a sharp optimum at pH 6.5, the reported trans-Golgi pH. Thus, at pH 7.0 to 7.2, a likely trans-Golgi pH range in the presence of 10 to 15 mM ammonium, activities for both enzymes are reduced to 50\% to 60\%. Consequently, ammonium seems to alter the carbohydrate biosynthesis of TNFR-IgG by a pH-mediated effect on glycosyltransferase activity. \textcopyright{} 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

We performed a yeast two-hybrid screen by using the NH(2) terminus of PC2 and identified syntaxin-5 (Stx5) as a putative interacting partner. Coimmunoprecipitation studies in cell lines and kidney tissues confirmed interaction of PC2 with Stx5 in vivo. In vitro binding assays showed that the interaction between Stx5 and PC2 is direct and defined the respective interaction domains as the t-SNARE region of Stx5 and amino acids 5 to 72 of PC2. Single channel studies showed that interaction with Stx5 specifically reduces PC2 channel activity. Epithelial cells overexpressing mutant PC2 that does not bind Stx5 had increased baseline cytosolic Ca(2+) levels, decreased endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca(2+) stores, and reduced Ca(2+) release from ER stores in response to vasopressin stimulation. Cells lacking PC2 altogether had reduced cytosolic Ca(2+) levels. Our data suggest that PC2 in the ER plays a role in cellular Ca(2+) homeostasis and that Stx5 functions to inactivate PC2 and prevent leaking of Ca(2+) from ER stores. Modulation of the PC2/Stx5 interaction may be a useful target for impacting dysregulated intracellular Ca(2+) signaling associated with polycystic kidney disease.},

  abstract = {;Mannose 6-phosphate (M6P) receptors (the CD-MPR and CI-MPR) are type-I integral membrane glycoproteins that constitute the family of p-type lectins. They bind to M6P-containing lysosomal acid hydrolases and transport them from the Golgi to the endosomal\textendash lysosomal system. X-ray crystallographic studies have provided an understanding of the molecular mechanisms that govern carbohydrate recognition by the MPRs, and IGF-II recognition by the CI-MPR. A relatively deep carbohydrate-recognition domain accounts for the numerous interactions between the CD-MPR and its carbohydrate ligands. The liganded versus unliganded molecule shows a considerable conformational change that enables ligand binding by the receptor. The MPRs have a complex intracellular trafficking itinerary that includes cycling between the Golgi and the endosomes, and delivering acid hydrolases to the endosomal compartments. The anterograde trafficking of the MPRs is through GGA-assisted packaging into AP1-containing clathrin-coated carriers, whereas the retrieval from the endosomal system occurs through a combination of the PACS-1/AP1 and TIP47/Rab9 pathways. MPRs that reach the cell surface are internalized rapidly by AP2. The CI-MPR has further functions at the cell surface that include internalization of IGF-II for degradation in lysosomes and activation of latent transforming growth factor (TGF)-{$\beta$}1. Loss of heterozygosity at the CI-MPR locus has been reported in several human cancers. In several instances, the M6P- and IGF-II-binding domains of the remaining allele have been found to have mutations. Where examined, most of the mutations disrupted M6P- and/or IGF-II-binding properties.

  abstract = {After growth factor stimulation, kinases are activated to regulate multiple aspects of cell physiology. Activated Src is present on Golgi membranes, but its function here remains unclear. We find that Src regulates mucin-type protein O-glycosylation through redistribution of the initiating enzymes, polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyl transferases (GalNac-Ts), from the Golgi to the ER. Redistribution occurs after stimulation with EGF or PDGF in a Src-dependent manner and in cells with constitutively elevated Src activity. All GalNac-T family enzymes tested are affected, whereas multiple other glycosylation enzymes are not displaced from the Golgi. Upon Src activation, the COP-I coat is also redistributed in punctate structures that colocalize with GalNac-Ts and a dominant-negative Arf1 isoform, Arf1(Q71L), efficiently blocks GalNac-T redistribution, indicating that Src activates a COP-I\textendash dependent trafficking event. Finally, Src activation increases O-glycosylation initiation as seen by lectin staining and metabolic labeling. We propose that growth factor stimulation regulates O-glycosylation initiation in a Src-dependent fashion by GalNac-T redistribution to the ER.},

  abstract = {Skip to Next Section Transport vesicle formation requires the association of cytosolic proteins with the membrane. We have previously described a brefeldin-A sensitive, hydrophilic protein (p230), containing a very high frequency of heptad repeats, found in the cytosol and associated with Golgi membranes. We show here that p230 is localised on the trans-Golgi network, by immunogold labeling of HeLa cell cryosections using alpha 2,6 sialyltransferase as a compartment-specific marker. The role of G protein activators on the binding of p230 to Golgi membranes and in vesicle biogenesis has been investigated. Treatment of streptolysin-O permeabilised HeLa cells with either GTP gamma S or AlF4- resulted in accumulation of p230 on Golgi membranes. Furthermore, immunolabeling of isolated Golgi membranes treated with AlF4-, to induce the accumulation of vesicles, showed that p230 is predominantly localised to the cytoplasmic surface of trans-Golgi network-derived budding structures and small coated vesicles. p230-labeled vesicles have a thin (approximately 10 nm) electron dense cytoplasmic coat and could be readily distinguished from clathrin-coated vesicles. Dual immunogold labeling of perforated cells, or of cryosections of treated Golgi membranes, revealed that p230 and the trans-Golgi network-associated p200, which we show here to be distinct molecules, appear to be localised on separate populations of vesicles budding from the trans-Golgi network. These results strongly suggest the presence of distinct populations of non-clathrin coated vesicles derived from the trans-Golgi network. As p230 recycles between the cytosol and buds/vesicles of TGN membranes, a process regulated by G proteins, we propose that p230 is involved in the biogenesis of a specific population of non-clathrin coated vesicles.},

However, the pathways of membrane traffic within the Golgi are still uncertain. Most of the available data can be accommodated by the cisternal maturation model, which postulates that Golgi cisternae form de novo, carry secretory cargoes forward and ultimately disappear. The entry face of the Golgi receives material that has been exported from transitional endoplasmic reticulum sites, and the exit face of the Golgi is intimately connected with endocytic compartments. These conserved features are enhanced by cell-type-specific elaborations such as tubular connections between mammalian Golgi cisternae. Key mechanistic questions remain about the formation and maturation of Golgi cisternae, the recycling of resident Golgi proteins, the origins of Golgi compartmental identity, the establishment of Golgi architecture, and the roles of Golgi structural elements in membrane traffic.},

Each model is assessed for its ability to explain a set of key observations encompassing multiple cell types. No single model can easily explain all of the observations from diverse organisms.

  abstract = {Relationship between intracellular proton buffering capacity and intracellular pH. In a recent publication the widely held view that the intracellular proton buffering power [defined as the amount of acid or base that has to be added to the cytosol to change the intracellular pH (pHi) by one pH unit] increases as the intracellular pH decreases, has been challenged, with the opposite relationship being proposed. In that publication, buffering was defined not in terms of pH change, but in terms of the change in proton concentration. The reason for this re-definition was the fear that the conventional analysis, using as it does a logarithmic function (pHi), could bias the outcome in favor of an increasing buffering power with decreasing pHi. The new system uses a ``buffering co-efficient,'' defined as the number of protons necessary to be added to the cytosol to change the intracellular proton concentration by 1 mM. We report the use of both of these methods to analyze the relationship of pHi and buffering power, using human peripheral leucocytes loaded with the pH-sensitive fluorophore BCECF examined over a very wide range of pHi values (pHi 6.0 to 7.5). The most common method for pHi perturbation for the measurement of buffering is used, the rapid diffusion of ammonia across the cell membrane. In this study, analysis for both a bicarbonate-containing ``open'' system and for a Hepes-buffered ``closed'' system was performed. Unlike the previous publication, the intracellular and extracellular conditions were such that the change in pHi induced by the extracellular addition of an ammonia-containing compound (NH4Cl) was the same (0.15 to 0.25 pH unit) across the pHi range of 6.0 to 7.5. The pHrbuffering relationship varied depending on the analysis used, but taking into account the known properties of Na+/H+ exchange and the desirability of defence of the cell against intracellular acidosis, the traditional relationship seems conceptually to be the more satisfactory.},

Deletion studies show that the N-terminal half of Sly1p rather than the C-terminus (harbouring the E532K substitution in Sly1-20p) is most critical for its binding to Sed5p. These data appear to argue for an active rather than an inhibitory role of Sly1p in vesicle docking.},

In yeast, the V-ATPase is composed of 13 subunits consisting of a catalytic V1 domain of peripherally associated proteins and a proton-translocating V0 domain of integral membrane proteins. The regulatory subunit, Vma13p, was the first V-ATPase subunit to have its crystal structure determined. In addition to proteins forming the functional V-ATPase complex, three ER-localized proteins facilitate the assembly of the V0 subunits following their translation and insertion into the membrane of the ER.

However, previous YFPs show excessive pH sensitivity, chloride interference, poor photostability, or poor expression at 37 \textdegree C. Protein evolution in Escherichia coli has produced a new YFP named Citrine, in which the mutation Q69M confers a much lower pK a (5.7) than for previous YFPs, indifference to chloride, twice the photostability of previous YFPs, and much better expression at 37 \textdegree C and in organelles. The halide resistance is explained by a 2.2-\AA{} x-ray crystal structure of Citrine, showing that the methionine side chain fills what was once a large halide-binding cavity adjacent to the chromophore. Insertion of calmodulin within Citrine or fusion of cyan fluorescent protein, calmodulin, a calmodulin-binding peptide and Citrine has generated improved calcium indicators. These chimeras can be targeted to multiple cellular locations and have permitted the first single-cell imaging of free [Ca2+] in the Golgi. Citrine is superior to all previous YFPs except when pH or halide sensitivity is desired and is particularly advantageous within genetically encoded fluorescent indicators of physiological signals.},

The astounding number and complexity of carbohydrate structures on cell surfaces added support to the concept that glycoconjugates would function in cellular communication during development. Although the structural complexity inherent in glycoconjugates has slowed advances in our understanding of their functions, the complete sequencing of the genomes of organisms classically used in developmental studies (e.g., mice, Drosophila melanogaster, and Caenorhabditis elegans) has led to demonstration of essential functions for a number of glycoconjugates in developmental processes.

  abstract = {To analyze the mechanism of integral membrane protein localization in the early Golgi apparatus of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we have used Och1p, a cis-Golgi mannosyltransferase. A series of influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged fusion proteins was constructed in which invertase is appended to the Golgi-luminal carboxy terminus of full-length Och1p. Several constructs included a Kex2p cleavage site between the Och1p and invertase moieties to monitor transit to the Kex2p-containing TGN. Cells expressing an Och1p-invertase fusion do not secrete invertase, but those expressing an Och1p-Kex2p site-invertase fusion protein secrete high levels of invertase in a Kex2p-dependent manner. The Och1p-Kex2p site-invertase fusion protein is cleaved with a half-time of 5 min, and the process proceeds to completion. Before cleavage the protein receives glycosyl modifications indicative of passage through the medial- and trans-Golgi, therefore cleavage occurs after ordered anterograde transport through the Golgi to the TGN. Transit to distal compartments is not induced by the invertase moiety, since noninvertase fusion constructs encounter the same glycosyltransferases and Kex2p as well. The Och1p-HA moiety, irrespective of whether it is generated by cleavage of the fusion protein in the TGN or synthesized de novo, is degraded with a half-time of about 60 min. Thus, the half-time of degradation is 12-fold longer than the time required to reach the TGN. At steady state, de novo-synthesized and TGN-generated HA epitope-tagged Och1p reside in a compartment with a buoyant density identical to that of wild-type Och1p and distinct from that of the vacuole or the TGN. Finally, och1 null cells that express an Ochlp fusion construct known to rapidly encounter the TGN glycosylate invertase to the same extent as wild-type cells, indicating that they have phenotypically wild-type Och1p activity. These results lead us to propose a model for Och1p-HA localization that involves movement to distal compartments, at least as far as the TGN, followed by retrieval to the cis compartment, presumably by vesicular transport.},

  abstract = {Glycosylation is one of the most common modifications of proteins and lipids and also a major source of biological diversity in eukaryotes. It is critical for many basic cellular functions and recognition events that range from protein folding to cell signaling, immunological defense, and the development of multicellular organisms. Glycosylation takes place mainly in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus and involves dozens of functionally distinct glycosidases and glycosyltransferases. How the functions of these enzymes, which act sequentially and often competitively, are coordinated to faithfully synthesize a vast array of different glycan structures is currently unclear. Here, we investigate the supramolecular organization of the Golgi N- and O-glycosylation pathways in live cells using a FRET flow cytometric quantification approach. We show that the enzymes form enzymatically active homo- and/or heteromeric complexes within each pathway. However, no complexes composed of enzymes that operate in different pathways, were detected, which suggests that the pathways are physically distinct. In addition, we show that complex formation is mediated almost exclusively by the catalytic domains of the interacting enzymes. Our data also suggest that the heteromeric complexes are functionally more important than enzyme homomers. Heteromeric complex formation was found to be dependent on Golgi acidity, markedly impaired in acidification-defective cancer cells, and required for the efficient synthesis of cell surface glycans. Collectively, the results emphasize that the Golgi glycosylation pathways are functionally organized into complexes that are important for glycan synthesis.},

Current evidence indicates that they function as enzyme homomers and/or heteromers in the living cell. Here we investigate their organizational interplay and show that glycosyltransferase homomers are assembled in the endoplasmic reticulum. Upon transport to the Golgi, the majority of homomers are disassembled to allow the formation of enzyme heteromers between sequentially acting medial-Golgi enzymes GnT-I and GnT-II or trans-Golgi enzymes GalT-I and ST6Gal-I. This transition is driven by the acidic Golgi environment, as it was markedly inhibited by raising Golgi luminal pH with chloroquine. Our FRAP (fluorescence recovery after photobleaching) measurements showed that the complexes remain mobile Golgi membrane constituents that can relocate to the endoplasmic reticulum or to the scattered Golgi mini-stacks upon brefeldin A or nocodazole treatment, respectively. During this relocation, heteromers undergo a reverse transition back to enzyme homomers. These data unveil an unprecedented organizational interplay between Golgi N-glycosyltransferases that involves dynamic and organelle microenvironment-driven transitions between enzyme homomers and heteromers during their trafficking within the early secretory compartments.},

By immunoelectron microscopy we find that rsec22b and rbet1 are enriched in COPII-coated vesicles that bud from the ER and presumably fuse with nearby vesicular tubular clusters (VTCs). However, all of the SNAREs were found on both COPII- and COPI-coated membranes, indicating that similar SNARE machinery directs both vesicle pathways. rsec22b and rbet1 do not appear beyond the first Golgi cisterna, whereas syntaxin 5 and membrin penetrate deeply into the Golgi stacks. Temperature shifts reveal that membrin, rsec22b, rbet1, and syntaxin 5 are present together on membranes that rapidly recycle between peripheral and Golgi-centric locations. GOS-28, on the other hand, maintains a fixed localization in the Golgi. By immunoprecipitation analysis, syntaxin 5 exists in at least two major subcomplexes: one containing syntaxin 5 (34-kD isoform) and GOS-28, and another containing syntaxin 5 (41- and 34-kD isoforms), membrin, rsec22b, and rbet1. Both subcomplexes appear to involve direct interactions of each SNARE with syntaxin 5. Our results indicate a central role for complexes among rbet1, rsec22b, membrin, and syntaxin 5 (34 and 41 kD) at two membrane fusion interfaces: the fusion of ER-derived vesicles with VTCs, and the assembly of VTCs to form cis-Golgi elements.

As a basis for the specificity of vesicular transport reactions, each step in the secretory pathway appears to be handled by a distinct set of evolutionarily conserved proteins. Mammalian proteins responsible for vesicle trafficking at early steps in the secretory pathway are not well understood. In this report, we describe rat sec22 (rsec22) and rat bet1 (rbet1), mammalian sequence homologs of yeast proteins identified as mediators of endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi protein transport. rsec22 and rbet1 were expressed widely in mammalian tissues, as anticipated for proteins involved in fundamental membrane trafficking reactions. Recombinant rsec22 and rbet1 proteins behaved as integral membrane components of 28 and 18 kDa, respectively, consistent with their primary structures, which contain a predicted transmembrane domain at or near the carboxyl terminus. Recombinant rsec22 and rbet1 had distinct subcellular localizations, with rsec22 residing on endoplasmic reticulum membranes and rbet1 found on Golgi membranes. Studies with brefeldin A and nocodazole indicated that rbet1 function might involve interaction with or retention in the intermediate compartment. The distinct localizations of rsec22 and rbet1 may reflect their participation in opposite directions of membrane flow between the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus.},

The sugars are added to nascent proteins as a core oligosaccharide unit, which is then extensively modified by removal and addition of sugar residues in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi complex. It has become evident that the modifications that take place in the ER reflect a spectrum of functions related to glycoprotein folding, quality control, sorting, degradation, and secretion. The glycans not only promote folding directly by stabilizing polypeptide structures but also indirectly by serving as recognition ``tags'' that allow glycoproteins to interact with a variety of lectins, glycosidases, and glycosyltranferases. Some of these (such as glucosidases I and II, calnexin, and calreticulin) have a central role in folding and retention, while others (such as {$\alpha$}-mannosidases and EDEM) target unsalvageable glycoproteins for ER-associated degradation. Each residue in the core oligosaccharide and each step in the modification program have significance for the fate of newly synthesized glycoproteins.},

ER stress engages the unfolded protein response (UPR), an adaptive reaction that reduces unfolded protein load to maintain cell viability and function.Conditions of chronic or irreversible ER stress trigger cell death by apoptosis, a process that involves the activation of the canonical mitochondrial pathway, which is controlled by the B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) protein family. Chronic ER stress has been linked to the occurrence of many diseases, including cancer, neurodegeneration, ischaemia and diabetes.The UPR is a complex signal transduction pathway that is initiated by the activation of at least three UPR stress sensors: inositol-requiring protein 1 (IRE1), protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK) and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). These sensors controls adaptive process through both transcriptional and non-transcriptional responses, affecting almost every aspect of the secretory pathway, including protein folding, ER biogenesis, ER-associated degradation (ERAD), protein entry to the ER, autophagy and secretion, among others.UPR signalling has distinct kinetics, intensities and downstream consequences depending on the nature and intensity of the stimuli and the cell type involved. These effects may be explained by the modulation of UPR stress sensor activity through interactions with several modulators and adaptor proteins, which possibly results in the assembly of dynamic signalling platforms that have been referred to as 'UPRosomes'.Recent advances in the UPR field indicate that this pathway has important functions in many physiological processes that are not directly related to protein folding. For example, UPR signalling modules crosstalk with signalling pathways that are key in the control of lipid and energy metabolism, innate immunity and cell differentiation programmes.},

Here, we present insights into the disrupted N-glycosylation of various CDG patients exhibiting defects in the transport of nucleotide sugars, Golgi glycosylation or Golgi trafficking. We studied enzymatically released N-glycans of total plasma proteins and affinity purified immunoglobulin G (IgG) from patients and healthy controls using mass spectrometry (MS). The applied method allowed the differentiation of sialic acid linkage isomers via their derivatization. Furthermore, protein-specific glycan profiles were quantified for transferrin and IgG Fc using electrospray ionization MS of intact proteins and glycopeptides, respectively. Next to the previously described glycomic effects, we report unprecedented sialic linkage-specific effects. Defects in proteins involved in Golgi trafficking (COG5-CDG) and CMP-sialic acid transport (SLC35A1-CDG) resulted in lower levels of sialylated structures on plasma proteins as compared to healthy controls. Findings for these specific CDGs include a more pronounced effect for \&alpha;2,3-sialylation than for \&alpha;2,6-sialylation.

  abstract = {The AP-5 adaptor protein complex is presumed to function in membrane traffic, but so far nothing is known about its pathway or its cargo. We have used CRISPR-Cas9 to knock out the AP-5 {$\zeta$} subunit gene, AP5Z1, in HeLa cells, and then analysed the phenotype by subcellular fractionation profiling and quantitative mass spectrometry. The retromer complex had an altered steady-state distribution in the knockout cells, and several Golgi proteins, including GOLIM4 and GOLM1, were depleted from vesicle-enriched fractions. Immunolocalisation showed that loss of AP-5 led to impaired retrieval of the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CIMPR), GOLIM4, and GOLM1 from endosomes back to the Golgi region. Knocking down the retromer complex exacerbated this phenotype. Both the CIMPR and sortilin interacted with the AP-5\textendash associated protein SPG15 in pull-down assays, and we propose that sortilin may act as a link between Golgi proteins and the AP-5/SPG11/SPG15 complex. Together, our findings suggest that AP-5 functions in a novel sorting step out of late endosomes, acting as a backup pathway for retromer.

Vaccination with irradiated tumor cells engineered to secrete granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) generates potent, specific, and long-lasting antitumor immunity in multiple murine tumor models. A phase I clinical trial of this vaccination strategy in patients with advanced melanoma demonstrated the consistent induction of dense CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocyte and plasma cell infiltrates in distant metastases, resulting in extensive tumor destruction, fibrosis, and edema. Antimelanoma antibody and cytotoxic T cell responses were associated with tumor cell death. To characterize the targets of these responses, we screened an autologous cDNA expression library prepared from a densely infiltrated metastasis with postvaccination sera from a long-term responding patient. High-titer IgG antibodies detected ATP6S1, a putative accessory unit of the vacuolar H+\textendash ATPase complex. A longitudinal analysis of this patient revealed an association between the vaccine-induced increase in antibodies to ATP6S1 and tumor destruction. Three additional vaccinated melanoma patients and three metastatic non-small cell lung carcinoma patients vaccinated with autologous GM-CSF-secreting tumor cells similarly showed a correlation between humoral responses to ATP6S1 and tumor destruction. Moreover, a chronic myelogenous leukemia patient who experienced a complete remission after CD4+ donor lymphocyte infusions also developed high-titer antibodies to ATP6S1. Lastly, vaccination with GM-CSF-secreting B16 melanoma cells stimulated high-titer antibodies to ATPS1 in a murine model. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that potent humoral responses to ATP6S1 are associated with immune-mediated destruction of diverse tumors.},

  abstract = {Visualizing whole cells at many scales Cells need to compartmentalize thousands of distinct proteins, but the nanoscale spatial relationship of many proteins to overall intracellular ultrastructure remains poorly understood. Correlated light and electron microscopy approaches can help. Hoffman et al. combined cryogenic super-resolution fluorescence microscopy and focused ion beam\textendash milling scanning electron microscopy to visualize protein-ultrastructure relationships in three dimensions across whole cells. The fusion of the two imaging modalities enabled identification and three-dimensional segmentation of morphologically complex structures within the crowded intracellular environment. The researchers observed unexpected relationships within a variety of cell types, including a web-like protein adhesion network between juxtaposed cerebellar granule neurons. Science, this issue p. eaaz5357 Structured Abstract INTRODUCTIONOur textbook understanding of the nanoscale organization of the cell and its relationship to the thousands of proteins that drive cellular metabolism comes largely from a synthesis of biochemistry, molecular biology, and electron microscopy, and is therefore speculative in its details. Correlative super-resolution (SR) fluorescence and electron microscopy (EM) promises to elucidate these details by directly visualizing the nanoscale relationship of specific proteins in the context of the global cellular ultrastructure. However, to date such correlative imaging has involved compromises with respect to ultrastructure preservation and imaging sensitivity, resolution, and/or field of view. RATIONALEWe developed a pipeline to (i) preserve fluorescently labeled, cultured mammalian cells in vitreous ice; (ii) image selected cells in their entirety below 10 K by multicolor three-dimensional structured illumination (3D SIM) and single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM); (iii) image the same cells by 3D focused ion beam scanning EM (FIB-SEM) at 4- or 8-nm isotropic resolution; and (iv) register all image volumes to nanoscale precision. The pipeline ensures accurate ultrastructure preservation, permits independent optimization of SR and EM imaging modalities, and provides a comprehensive view of how specific subcellular components vary across the cellular volume. RESULTSNearly every system we studied revealed unexpected results: intranuclear vesicles positive for a marker of the endoplasmic reticulum; peroxisomes of increasingly irregular morphology with increasing size; endolysosomal compartments of exceptionally diverse and convoluted morphology; a web-like adhesion network between cerebellar granule neurons; and classically EM-defined domains of heterochromatin and euchromatin each sub-characterized by the presence or absence of markers of transcriptional activity. Two-color cryo-SMLM enabled whole-cell image registration quantifiable down to \textasciitilde 40 nm accuracy. Cryo-SIM, even with its lower resolution, enabled unique discrimination between vesicles of like morphology and aided in segmenting complex 3D structures at FIB-SEM resolution within the crowded intracellular milieu. CONCLUSIONOur pipeline serves as a powerful hypothesis generator to better understand the findings of biochemistry in the context of the spatially compartmentalized cell. Our approach also carefully preserves the native ultrastructure upon which such hypotheses are based, thus enabling cell-wide or cell-to-cell investigation of the natural variability in protein-ultrastructure relationships. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/367/6475/eaaz5357/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Whole-cell correlative imaging.Cryogenic super-resolution fluorescence microscopy of high-pressure frozen cells coupled with focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) enables multicolor three-dimensional nanoscale visualization of proteins in the context of global ultrastructure. Clockwise from upper left: Volume-rendered cell with correlated orthoslice (inset) of mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteins; endolysosomal compartments of diverse morphology; heterochomatin subdomains defined by protein reporters of transcriptional activity; adhesion proteins correlated to membrane roughness at contacting cerebellar granule neurons; and a peroxisome (pink) juxtaposed to an ER sheet (red) and mitochondrion (cyan). Within cells, the spatial compartmentalization of thousands of distinct proteins serves a multitude of diverse biochemical needs. Correlative super-resolution (SR) fluorescence and electron microscopy (EM) can elucidate protein spatial relationships to global ultrastructure, but has suffered from tradeoffs of structure preservation, fluorescence retention, resolution, and field of view. We developed a platform for three-dimensional cryogenic SR and focused ion beam\textendash milled block-face EM across entire vitreously frozen cells. The approach preserves ultrastructure while enabling independent SR and EM workflow optimization. We discovered unexpected protein-ultrastructure relationships in mammalian cells including intranuclear vesicles containing endoplasmic reticulum\textendash associated proteins, web-like adhesions between cultured neurons, and chromatin domains subclassified on the basis of transcriptional activity. Our findings illustrate the value of a comprehensive multimodal view of ultrastructural variability across whole cells.

It is thought that they form a tight four-helix complex between membranes, in effect initiating fusion. Most SNAREs contain a single coiled-coil region, referred to as the SNARE motif, directly adjacent to a single transmembrane domain. The neuronal SNARE SNAP-25 defines a subfamily of SNARE proteins with two SNARE helices connected by a longer linker, comprising also the proteins SNAP-23 and SNAP-29. We now report the initial characterization of a novel vertebrate homologue termed SNAP-47. Northern blot and immunoblot analysis revealed ubiquitous tissue distribution, with particularly high levels in nervous tissue. In neurons, SNAP-47 shows a widespread distribution on intracellular membranes and is also enriched in synaptic vesicle fractions. In vitro, SNAP-47 substituted for SNAP-25 in SNARE complex formation with the neuronal SNAREs syntaxin 1a and synaptobrevin 2, and it also substituted for SNAP-25 in proteoliposome fusion. However, neither complex assembly nor fusion was as efficient as with SNAP-25.},

A search for genes coordinately expressed with the prohormone proopiomelanocortin (POMC) in the melanotrope cells of Xenopus intermediate pituitary led to the isolation of a cDNA encoding the complete amino-acid sequence of the type I transmembrane V-ATPase accessory subunit Ac45 (predicted size 48 kDa). Comparison of Xenopus and mammalian Ac45 sequences revealed conserved regions in the protein that may be of functional importance. Western blot analysis showed that immunoreactive Ac45 represents a {$\approx$} 40-kDa product that is expressed predominantly in neuroendocrine tissues; deglycosylation resulted in a {$\approx$} 27-kDa immunoreactive Ac45 product which is smaller than predicted for the intact protein. Biosynthetic studies revealed that newly synthesized Xenopus Ac45 is an N-glycosylated protein of {$\approx$} 60 kDa; the nonglycosylated, newly synthesized form is {$\approx$} 46 kDa which is similar to the predicted size. Immunocytochemical analysis showed that in Xenopus pituitary, Ac45 is highly expressed in the biosynthetically active melanotrope cells. We conclude that the regionally conserved Xenopus Ac45 protein is synthesized as an N-glycosylated {$\approx$} 60-kDa precursor that is intracellularly cleaved to an {$\approx$} 40-kDa product and speculate that it may assist in the V-ATPase-mediated acidification of neuroendocrine secretory granules.},

Recent studies suggest that tethering factors also positively regulate the assembly of functional SNARE complexes, thereby coupling tethering with fusion events. This coupling is mediated, at least in part, by direct physical interactions between tethering factors, SNAREs, and Sec1/Munc18 (SM) proteins.

Homozygous scfd1 mutant embryos exhibit a profound craniofacial abnormality caused by a failure of chondrogenesis. Loss of scfd1 was found to hinder ER to Golgi transport of ECM proteins and is accompanied with activation of the unfolded protein response in chondrocytes. We further demonstrate a conserved role for Scfd1 in differentiation of mammalian chondrocytes, in which loss of either SCFD1 or STX18, a SLY1 interacting t-SNARE, severely impair transport of type II collagen. These results show that the existence of a specific export pathway, mediated by a complex containing SCFD1 and STX18 that plays an essential role in secretion of large ECM proteins during chondrogenesis.},

Syn5 is monoubiquitinated by the ubiquitin ligase HACE1 in early mitosis and deubiquitinated by the deubiquitinase VCIP135 in late mitosis. Syn5 ubiquitination on lysine 270 (K270) in the SNARE domain impairs the interaction between Syn5 and the cognate v-SNARE Bet1 but increases its binding to p47, the adaptor protein of p97. Expression of the Syn5 K270R mutant in cells impairs post-mitotic Golgi reassembly. Therefore, monoubiquitination of Syn5 in early mitosis disrupts SNARE complex formation. Subsequently, ubiquitinated Syn5 recruits p97/p47 to the mitotic Golgi fragments and promotes post-mitotic Golgi reassembly upon ubiquitin removal by VCIP135. Overall, this study reveals both the substrate and the mechanism of ubiquitin-mediated regulation of Golgi membrane dynamics during the cell cycle.},

We now show that there are two forms of syntaxin 5 that appear to be generated from the same mRNA by alternative initiation of translation. The short form (35 kDa) corresponds to the published sequence. The long form (42 kDa) has an N-terminal cytoplasmic extension containing a predicted type II ER retrieval signal. When grafted onto a reporter molecule, this signal localized the construct to the ER. Biochemical fractionation and immunofluorescence microscopy showed that there was less of the long form in the Golgi apparatus and more in peripheral punctate structures, some of which colocalized with markers of the intermediate compartment. The predicted absence of the long form in budding yeast points to a function unique to higher organisms.},

The a2-isoform is targeted to early endosomes, interacts with ARNO in an intra-endosomal acidification-dependent manner, and disruption of this interaction results in reversible inhibition of endocytosis. Inhibition of endosomal acidification abrogates protein trafficking between early and late endosomal compartments. These data demonstrate the crucial role of early endosomal acidification and V-ATPase/ARNO/Arf6 interactions in the regulation of the endocytic degradative pathway. They also indicate that V-ATPase could modulate membrane trafficking by recruiting and interacting with ARNO and Arf6; characteristics that are consistent with the role of V-ATPase as an essential component of the endosomal pH-sensing machinery.},

  abstract = {V-ATPases constitute a ubiquitous family of heteromultimeric, proton translocating proteins. According to their localization in a multitude of eukaryotic endomembranes and plasma membranes, they energize many different transport processes. Currently, a handful of specific inhibitors of the V-ATPase are known, which represent valuable tools for the characterization of transport processes on the level of tissues, single cells or even purified proteins. The understanding of how these inhibitors function may provide a basis to develop new drugs for the benefit of patients suffering from diseases such as osteoporosis or cancer. For this purpose, it appears absolutely essential to determine the exact inhibitor binding site in a target protein on the one side and to uncover the crucial structural elements of an inhibitor on the other side. However, even for some of the most popular and long known V-ATPase inhibitors, such as bafilomycin or concanamycin, the authentic structures of their binding sites are elusive. The aim of this review is to summarize the recent advances for the old players in the inhibition game, the plecomacrolides bafilomycin and concanamycin, and to introduce some of the new players, the macrolacton archazolid, the benzolactone enamides salicylihalamide, lobatamide, apicularen, oximidine and cruentaren, and the indolyls.},

In this review, we discuss how Rabs can regulate virtually all steps of membrane traffic from the formation of the transport vesicle at the donor membrane to its fusion at the target membrane. Some of the many regulatory functions performed by Rabs include interacting with diverse effector proteins that select cargo, promoting vesicle movement, and verifying the correct site of fusion. We describe cascade mechanisms that may define directionality in traffic and ensure that different Rabs do not overlap in the pathways that they regulate. Throughout this review we highlight how Rab dysfunction leads to a variety of disease states ranging from infectious diseases to cancer.},

Whereas some cell types are amenable to genome engineering, genomes of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) have been difficult to engineer, with reduced efficiencies relative to tumour cell lines or mouse embryonic stem cells3\textendash 13. Here, using hPSC lines with stable integration of Cas9 or transient delivery of Cas9-ribonucleoproteins (RNPs), we achieved an average insertion or deletion (indel) efficiency greater than 80\%. This high efficiency of indel generation revealed that double-strand breaks (DSBs) induced by Cas9 are toxic and kill most hPSCs. In previous studies, the toxicity of Cas9 in hPSCs was less apparent because of low transfection efficiency and subsequently low DSB induction3. The toxic response to DSBs was P53/TP53-dependent, such that the efficiency of precise genome engineering in hPSCs with a wild-type P53 gene was severely reduced. Our results indicate that Cas9 toxicity creates an obstacle to the high-throughput use of CRISPR/Cas9 for genome engineering and screening in hPSCs. Moreover, as hPSCs can acquire P53 mutations14, cell replacement therapies using CRISPR/Cas9-enginereed hPSCs should proceed with caution, and such engineered hPSCs should be monitored for P53 function.},

Two recent studies highlight the fact that properties of membrane lipids play key roles in Golgi structural organization and trafficking. The Antonny laboratory has demonstrated the mechanism by which a Golgi tether containing a membrane-curvature-sensing domain at one end can link highly curved and flat membranes together in a reversible manner. In this way, a strong interaction that binds membranes together in an oriented fashion can easily be disrupted as the properties of the membranes change. The Lippincott-Schwartz laboratory has developed a new model for intra-Golgi trafficking, called the rapid-partitioning model, which incorporates lipid trafficking as an integral part. Simulations reveal that the sorting of lipids into processing and export domains that are connected to each Golgi cisterna, and bidirectional trafficking throughout the Golgi to allow proteins to associate with their preferred lipid environment, is sufficient to drive protein transport through the secretory pathway. Although only a proof in principle, this model for the first time invokes lipid sorting as the driving force in intra-Golgi trafficking, and provides a framework for future experimental work.},

Other yeast genes have been identified that are required for V-ATPase assembly but whose protein products do not co-purify with the enzyme complex. One such gene,VMA12, encodes a 25-kDa protein (Vma12p) that is predicted to contain two membrane-spanning domains. Biochemical analysis has revealed that Vma12p behaves as an integral membrane protein with both the N and C termini oriented toward the cytosol, and this protein immunolocalizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In cells lacking Vma12p (vma12{$\Delta$}), the 100-kDa subunit of the V0 complex (which contains six to eight putative membrane-spanning domains) was rapidly degraded (t{$\frac{1}{2}$} {$\sim$} 30 min). Protease protection assays revealed that the 100-kDa subunit was inserted/translocated correctly into the ER membrane of vma12{$\Delta$} cells. These data indicate that Vma12p functions in the ER after the insertion of V0subunits into the ER membrane. We propose that Vma12p functions directly in the assembly of the V0 subunits into a complex in the ER, and that assembly is required for the stability of the V0 subunits and their transport as a complex out of this compartment.},

Algorithms are used as metaphors for complex biological processes such as organismal development. Here we make this metaphor rigorous for glycan biosynthesis. Glycans are branched sugar oligomers that are attached to cell-surface proteins and convey cellular identity. Eukaryotic O-glycans are synthesized by collections of enzymes in Golgi compartments. A compartment can stochastically convert a single input oligomer to a heterogeneous set of possible output oligomers; yet a given type of protein is invariably associated with a narrow and reproducible glycan oligomer profile. Here we resolve this paradox by borrowing from the theory of algorithmic self-assembly. We rigorously enumerate the sources of glycan microheterogeneity: incomplete oligomers via early exit from the reaction compartment; tandem repeat oligomers via runaway reactions; and competing oligomer fates via divergent reactions. We demonstrate how to diagnose and eliminate each of these, thereby obtaining ``algorithmic compartments'' that convert inputs to corresponding unique outputs. Given an input and a target output we either prove that the output cannot be algorithmically synthesized from the input, or explicitly construct an ordered series of algorithmic compartments that achieves this synthesis. Our theoretical analysis allows us to infer the causes of non-algorithmic microheterogeneity and species-specific diversity in real glycan datasets.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Specific enzymes within successive compartments of the Golgi apparatus determine where new monomer building blocks are linked to the growing oligomer. These enzymes act promiscuously and stochastically, causing microheterogeneity (molecule-to-molecule variability) in the final oligomer products. However, this variability is tightly controlled: a given eukaryotic protein type is typically associated with a narrow, specific glycan oligomer profile. Here, we use ideas from the mathematical theory of self-assembly to enumerate the enzymatic causes of oligomer variability and show how to eliminate each cause. We rigorously demonstrate that cells can specifically synthesize a larger repertoire of glycan oligomers by partitioning promiscuous enzymes across multiple Golgi compartments. This places limits on biomolecular assembly: glycan microheterogeneity becomes unavoidable when the number of compartments is limited, or enzymes are excessively promiscuous.},

However, the molecules and mechanisms involved in fusion of these vesicles are not well understood. We have employed a system to simultaneously monitor release of luminal and membrane biosynthetic cargoes from individual post-Golgi vesicles. Exocytosis of these vesicles is not calcium triggered. Release of luminal cargo can be accompanied by complete, partial, or no release of membrane cargo. Partial and no release of membrane cargo of a fusing vesicle are fates associated with kiss-and-run exocytosis, and we find that these are the predominant mode of post-Golgi vesicle exocytosis. Partial cargo release by post-Golgi vesicles occurs because of premature closure of the fusion pore and is modulated by the activity of clathrin, actin, and dynamin. Our results demonstrate that these components of the endocytic machinery modulate the nature and extent of biosynthetic cargo delivery by post-Golgi vesicles at the cell membrane.},

How the V-ATPase is regulated, e.g. by an accessory subunit, remains elusive. Here we explored the role of the neuroendocrine V-ATPase accessory subunit Ac45 via its transgenic expression specifically in the Xenopus intermediate pituitary melanotrope cell model. The Ac45-transgene product did not affect the levels of the prohormone proopiomelanocortin nor of V-ATPase subunits, but rather caused an accumulation of the V-ATPase at the plasma membrane. Furthermore, a higher abundance of secretory granules, protrusions of the plasma membrane and an increased Ca(2+)-dependent secretion efficiency were observed in the Ac45-transgenic cells. We conclude that in neuroendocrine cells Ac45 guides the V-ATPase through the secretory pathway, thereby regulating the V-ATPase-mediated process of Ca(2+)-dependent peptide secretion.},

  abstract = {Disorders of Golgi homeostasis form an emerging group of genetic defects. The highly heterogeneous clinical spectrum is not explained by our current understanding of the underlying cell-biological processes in the Golgi. Therefore, uncovering genetic defects and annotating gene function are challenging. Exome sequencing in a family with three siblings affected by abnormal Golgi glycosylation revealed a homozygous missense mutation, c.92T{$>$}C (p.Leu31Ser), in coiled-coil domain containing 115 (CCDC115), the function of which is unknown. The same mutation was identified in three unrelated families, and in one family it was compound heterozygous in combination with a heterozygous deletion of CCDC115. An additional homozygous missense mutation, c.31G{$>$}T (p.Asp11Tyr), was found in a family with two affected siblings. All individuals displayed a storage-disease-like phenotype involving hepatosplenomegaly, which regressed with age, highly elevated bone-derived alkaline phosphatase, elevated aminotransferases, and elevated cholesterol, in combination with abnormal copper metabolism and neurological symptoms. Two individuals died of liver failure, and one individual was successfully treated by liver transplantation. Abnormal N- and mucin type O-glycosylation was found on serum proteins, and reduced metabolic labeling of sialic acids was found in fibroblasts, which was restored after complementation with wild-type CCDC115. PSI-BLAST homology detection revealed reciprocal homology with Vma22p, the yeast V-ATPase assembly factor located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Human CCDC115 mainly localized to the ERGIC and to COPI vesicles, but not to the ER. These data, in combination with the phenotypic spectrum, which is distinct from that associated with defects in V-ATPase core subunits, suggest a more general role for CCDC115 in Golgi trafficking. Our study reveals CCDC115 deficiency as a disorder of Golgi homeostasis that can be readily identified via screening for abnormal glycosylation in plasma.},

  abstract = {Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs) form a genetically and clinically heterogeneous group of diseases with aberrant protein glycosylation as a hallmark. A subgroup of CDGs can be attributed to disturbed Golgi homeostasis. However, identification of pathogenic variants is seriously complicated by the large number of proteins involved. As part of a strategy to identify human homologs of yeast proteins that are known to be involved in Golgi homeostasis, we identified uncharacterized transmembrane protein 199 (TMEM199, previously called C17orf32) as a human homolog of yeast V-ATPase assembly factor Vph2p (also known as Vma12p). Subsequently, we analyzed raw exome-sequencing data from families affected by genetically unsolved CDGs and identified four individuals with different mutations in TMEM199. The adolescent individuals presented with a mild phenotype of hepatic steatosis, elevated aminotransferases and alkaline phosphatase, and hypercholesterolemia, as well as low serum ceruloplasmin. Affected individuals showed abnormal N- and mucin-type O-glycosylation, and mass spectrometry indicated reduced incorporation of galactose and sialic acid, as seen in other Golgi homeostasis defects. Metabolic labeling of sialic acids in fibroblasts confirmed deficient Golgi glycosylation, which was restored by lentiviral transduction with wild-type TMEM199. V5-tagged TMEM199 localized with ERGIC and COPI markers in HeLa cells, and electron microscopy of a liver biopsy showed dilated organelles suggestive of the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. In conclusion, we have identified TMEM199 as a protein involved in Golgi homeostasis and show that TMEM199 deficiency results in a hepatic phenotype with abnormal glycosylation.},

  abstract = {The regulation of the V-ATPase, the proton pump mediating intraorganellar acidification, is still elusive. We find that excess of the neuroendocrine V-ATPase accessory subunit Ac45 reduces the intragranular pH and consequently disturbs prohormone convertase activation and prohormone processing. Thus, Ac45 represents the first V-ATPase regulator., The vacuolar (H+)-ATPase (V-ATPase) is an important proton pump, and multiple critical cell-biological processes depend on the proton gradient provided by the pump. Yet, the mechanism underlying the control of the V-ATPase is still elusive but has been hypothesized to involve an accessory subunit of the pump. Here we studied as a candidate V-ATPase regulator the neuroendocrine V-ATPase accessory subunit Ac45. We transgenically manipulated the expression levels of the Ac45 protein specifically in Xenopus intermediate pituitary melanotrope cells and analyzed in detail the functioning of the transgenic cells. We found in the transgenic melanotrope cells the following: i) significantly increased granular acidification; ii) reduced sensitivity for a V-ATPase-specific inhibitor; iii) enhanced early processing of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) by prohormone convertase PC1; iv) reduced, neutral pH\textendash dependent cleavage of the PC2 chaperone 7B2; v) reduced 7B2-proPC2 dissociation and consequently reduced proPC2 maturation; vi) decreased levels of mature PC2 and consequently reduced late POMC processing. Together, our results show that the V-ATPase accessory subunit Ac45 represents the first regulator of the proton pump and controls V-ATPase-mediated granular acidification that is necessary for efficient prohormone processing.},

We show here that in a subset of these systems, the mature crRNA that is base-paired to trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) forms a two-RNA structure that directs the CRISPR-associated protein Cas9 to introduce double-stranded (ds) breaks in target DNA. At sites complementary to the crRNA-guide sequence, the Cas9 HNH nuclease domain cleaves the complementary strand, whereas the Cas9 RuvC-like domain cleaves the noncomplementary strand. The dual-tracrRNA:crRNA, when engineered as a single RNA chimera, also directs sequence-specific Cas9 dsDNA cleavage. Our study reveals a family of endonucleases that use dual-RNAs for site-specific DNA cleavage and highlights the potential to exploit the system for RNA-programmable genome editing.

Genetic and biochemical studies have implicated impaired lysosomal and mitochondrial function in the pathogenesis of PD. Transmembrane protein 175 (TMEM175), the lysosomal K+ channel, is centered under a major genome-wide association studies peak for PD, making it a potential candidate risk factor for the disease. To address the possibility that variation in TMEM175 could play a role in PD pathogenesis, TMEM175 function was investigated in a neuronal model system. Studies confirmed that TMEM175 deficiency results in unstable lysosomal pH, which led to decreased lysosomal catalytic activity, decreased glucocerebrosidase activity, impaired autophagosome clearance by the lysosome, and decreased mitochondrial respiration. Moreover, TMEM175 deficiency in rat primary neurons resulted in increased susceptibility to exogenous {$\alpha$}-synuclein fibrils. Following {$\alpha$}-synuclein fibril treatment, neurons deficient in TMEM175 were found to have increased phosphorylated and detergent-insoluble {$\alpha$}-synuclein deposits. Taken together, data from these studies suggest that TMEM175 plays a direct and critical role in lysosomal and mitochondrial function and PD pathogenesis and highlight this ion channel as a potential therapeutic target for treating PD.},

Repetitive cycles of membrane fusion likely involve repetitive folding/unfolding of the SNARE motif helical structure.

Here we demonstrate that hsc70 chaperones stimulate in vitro SNARE complex formation among the ER/Golgi SNAREs syntaxin 5, membrin, rbet1 and sec22b, under conditions in which assembly is normally inhibited. Thus, molecular chaperones can render the SNARE motif more competent for assembly. Partially purified hsc70 fractions from brain cytosol had higher specific activities than fully purified hsc70, suggesting the involvement of unidentified cofactors. Using chemical crosslinking of cells followed by immunoprecipitation, we found that hsc70 was associated with ER/Golgi SNAREs in vivo. Consistent with a modulatory role for hsc70 in transport, we found that excess hsc70 specifically inhibited ER-to-Golgi transport in permeabilized cells.},

An increased passive (leak) permeability to protons, together with reduced vacuolar H+\textendash adenosine triphosphatase (V-ATPase) activity, accounts for the reduced acidifying ability of peripheral lysosomes. The altered composition of peripheral lysosomes is due, at least in part, to more limited access to material exported by the biosynthetic pathway. The balance between Rab7 and Arl8b determines the subcellular localization of lysosomes; more peripheral lysosomes have reduced Rab7 density. This in turn results in decreased recruitment of Rab-interacting lysosomal protein (RILP), an effector that regulates the recruitment and stability of the V1G1 component of the lysosomal V-ATPase. Deliberate margination of lysosomes is associated with reduced acidification and impaired proteolytic activity. The heterogeneity in lysosomal pH may be an indication of a broader functional versatility.},

For these clinical applications, generation of DC under Good Manufacturing Practice conditions and without the use of animal products is a main prerequisite. To date, there are many different DC culture protocols, which subsequently lead to different types of DC. Protocols differ not only in DC preparation techniques, but also many other variables, like maturation status, dose and timing interval, route of administration, and antigen loading.

  abstract = {Podosomes are multimolecular cytoskeletal structures that coordinate the migration of tissue-resident dendritic cells (DCs). They consist of a protrusive actin-rich core and an adhesive integrin-rich ring that contains adaptor proteins such as vinculin and zyxin. Individual podosomes are typically interconnected by a dense network of actin filaments giving rise to large podosome clusters. The actin density in podosome clusters complicates the analysis of podosomes by light microscopy alone. Here, we present an optimized procedure for performing super-resolution correlative light and electron microscopy (SR-CLEM) to study the organization of multiple proteins with respect to actin in podosome clusters at the ventral plasma membrane of DCs. We demonstrate that our procedure is suited to correlate at least three colors in super-resolution Airyscan microscopy with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Using this procedure, we first reveal an intriguing complexity in the organization of ventral and radiating actin filaments in clusters formed by DCs which was not properly detected before by light microscopy alone. Next, we demonstrate a differential organization of vinculin and zyxin with respect to the actin filaments at podosomes. While vinculin mostly resides at sites where the actin filaments connect to the cell membrane, zyxin is primarily associated with filaments close to and on top of the core. Finally, we reveal a novel actin-based structure with SEM that connects closely associated podosome cores and which may be important for podosome topography sensing. Interestingly, these interpodosomal connections, in contrast to the radiating and ventral actin filaments appear to be insensitive to inhibition of actin polymerization suggesting that these pools of actin are not dynamically coupled. Together, our work demonstrates the power of correlating different imaging modalities for studying multimolecular cellular structures and could potentially be further exploited to study processes at the ventral plasma membrane of immune cells such as clathrin-mediated endocytosis or immune synapse formation.},

Mutations in this part of the genome-the GTf-genome-cause more than 58 rare, monogenic congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs). They are also statistically associated with a large number of complex phenotypes, diseases or predispositions to complex diseases based on Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS). CDGs are extremely rare and often with severe medical consequences. In contrast, GWAS are likely to identify more common genetic variations and generally involve less severe and distinct traits. We recently confirmed that structural defects in GTf genes are extremely rare, which seemed at odds with the large number of GWAS pointing to GTf-genes. To resolve this issue, we surveyed the GTf-genome for reported CDGs and GWAS candidates; we found little overlap between the two groups of genes. Moreover, GTf-genes implicated by CDG or GWAS appear to constitute different classes with respect to their: (i) predicted roles in glycosylation pathways; (ii) potential for partial redundancy by closely homologous genes; and (iii) transcriptional regulation as evaluated by RNAseq data. Our analysis suggest that more complex traits are caused by dysregulation rather than structural deficiency of GTfs, which suggests that some glycosylation reactions may be predicted to be under tight regulation for fine-tuning of important biological functions.},

They are classified as L-type lectins because of their luminal carbohydrate recognition domain, which exhibits homology to leguminous lectins. These L-type lectins have different intracellular distributions and dynamics in the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi system of the secretory pathway and interact with N-glycans of glycoproteins in a Ca2+-dependent manner, suggesting a role in glycoprotein sorting and trafficking. To understand the function of these lectins, knowledge of their carbohydrate specificity is crucial but only available for VIP36 (Kamiya, Y., Yamaguchi, Y., Takahashi, N., Arata, Y., Kasai, K. I., Ihara, Y., Matsuo, I., Ito, Y., Yamamoto, K., and Kato, K. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 37178\textendash 37182). Here we provide a comprehensive and quantitative analysis of sugar recognition of the carbohydrate recognition domains of ERGIC-53 and VIPL in comparison with VIP36 using a pyridylaminated sugar library in conjunction with frontal affinity chromatography. Frontal affinity chromatography revealed selective interaction of VIPL and VIP36 with the deglucosylated trimannose in the D1 branch of high-mannose-type oligosaccharides but with different pH dependence. ERGIC-53 bound high-mannose-type oligosaccharides with low affinity and broad specificity, not discriminating between monoglucosylated and deglucosylated high-mannosetype oligosaccharides. Based on the sugar-binding properties in conjunction with known features of these proteins, we propose a model for the action of the three lectins in glycoprotein guidance and trafficking. Moreover, structure-based mutagenesis revealed that the sugar-binding properties of these L-type lectins can be switched by single amino acid substitutions.},

  abstract = {Skip to Next Section Syntaxins are target-soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor-attachment protein receptors (t-SNAREs) involved in docking and fusion of vesicles in exocytosis and endocytosis. Many syntaxin isoforms have been isolated, and each one displays a distinct intracellular localization pattern. However, the signals that drive the specific intracellular localization of syntaxins are poorly understood. In this study, we used indirect immunofluorescence analysis to examine the localization of syntaxin chimeras, each containing a syntaxin transmembrane domain fused to a cytoplasmic domain derived from a different syntaxin. We show that the cytoplasmic domains of syntaxins 5, 6, 7 and 8 have important effects on intracellular localization. We also demonstrate that the transmembrane domain of syntaxin 5 is sufficient to localize the chimera to the compartment expected for wild-type syntaxin 5. Additionally, we find that syntaxins 6, 7 and 8, but not syntaxin 5, are present at the plasma membrane, and that these syntaxins cycle through the plasma membrane by virtue of their cytoplasmic domains. Finally, we find that di-leucine-based motifs in the cytoplasmic domains of syntaxins 7 and 8 are necessary for their intracellular localization and trafficking via distinct transport pathways. Combined, these results suggest that both the cytoplasmic and the transmembrane domains play important roles in intracellular localization and trafficking of syntaxins.},

The Vph1p-containing complex localizes to the vacuole, whereas the Stv1p-containing complex resides in some other intracellular compartment, suggesting that the a subunit contains information necessary for the correct targeting of the V-ATPase. We show that Stv1p localizes to a late Golgi compartment at steady state and cycles continuously via a prevacuolar endosome back to the Golgi. V-ATPase complexes containing Vph1p and Stv1p also differ in their assembly properties, coupling of proton transport to ATP hydrolysis, and dissociation in response to glucose depletion. To identify the regions of the a subunit that specify these different properties, chimeras were constructed containing the cytosolic amino-terminal domain of one isoform and the integral membrane, carboxyl-terminal domain from the other isoform. Like the Stv1p-containing complex, the V-ATPase complex containing the chimera with the amino-terminal domain of Stv1p localized to the Golgi and the complex did not dissociate in response to glucose depletion. Like the Vph1p-containing complex, the V-ATPase complex containing the chimera with the amino-terminal domain of Vph1p localized to the vacuole and the complex exhibited normal dissociation upon glucose withdrawal. Interestingly, the V-ATPase complex containing the chimera with the carboxyl-terminal domain of Vph1p exhibited a higher coupling of proton transport to ATP hydrolysis than the chimera containing the carboxyl-terminal domain of Stv1p. Our results suggest that whereas targeting and in vivo dissociation are controlled by sequences located in the amino-terminal domains of the subunit a isoforms, coupling efficiency is controlled by the carboxyl-terminal region.},

These genes encode unique isoforms of the a-subunit that have previously been shown to reside in different intracellular compartments in yeast. Vph1p localizes to the central vacuole, whereas Stv1p is present in some other compartment, possibly the Golgi or endosomes. To compare the properties of V-ATPases containing Vph1p or Stv1p, Stv1p was expressed at higher than normal levels in a strain disrupted in both genes, under which conditions V-ATPase complexes containing Stv1p appear in the vacuole. Complexes containing Stv1p showed lower assembly with the peripheral V(1) domain than did complexes containing Vph1p. When corrected for this lower degree of assembly, however, V-ATPase complexes containing Vph1p and Stv1p had similar kinetic properties. Both exhibited a K(m) for ATP of about 250 microm, and both showed resistance to sodium azide and vanadate and sensitivity to nanomolar concentrations of concanamycin A. Stv1p-containing complexes, however, showed a 4-5-fold lower ratio of proton transport to ATP hydrolysis than Vph1p-containing complexes. We also compared the ability of V-ATPase complexes containing Vph1p or Stv1p to undergo in vivo dissociation in response to glucose depletion. Vph1p-containing complexes present in the vacuole showed dissociation in response to glucose depletion, whereas Stv1p-containing complexes present in their normal intracellular location (Golgi/endosomes) did not. Upon overexpression of Stv1p, Stv1p-containing complexes present in the vacuole showed glucose-dependent dissociation. Blocking delivery of Vph1p-containing complexes to the vacuole in vps21Delta and vps27Delta strains caused partial inhibition of glucose-dependent dissociation. These results suggest that dissociation of the V-ATPase complex in vivo is controlled both by the cellular environment and by the 100-kDa a-subunit isoform present in the complex.},

  abstract = {Exocytic and endocytic compartments each have their own unique luminal ion and pH environment that is important for their normal functioning. A failure to maintain this environment - the loss of homeostasis - is not uncommon. In the worst case, all the main Golgi functions, including glycosylation, membrane trafficking and protein sorting, can be perturbed. Several factors contribute to Golgi homeostasis. These include not only ions such as H+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, but also Golgi redox state and nitric oxide (NO) levels, both of which are dependent on the oxygen levels in the cells. Changes to any one of these factors have consequences on Golgi functions, the nature of which can be dissimilar or similar depending upon the defects themselves. For example, altered Golgi pH homeostasis gives rise to Cutis laxa disease, in which glycosylation and membrane trafficking are both affected, while altered Ca2+ homeostasis due to the mutated SCPA1 gene in Hailey-Hailey disease, perturbs various protein sorting, proteolytic cleavage and membrane trafficking events in the Golgi. This review gives an overview of the molecular machineries involved in the maintenance of Golgi ion, pH and redox homeostasis, followed by a discussion of the organelle dysfunction and disease that frequently result from their breakdown. Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs) are discussed only when they contribute directly to Golgi pH, ion or redox homeostasis. Current evidence emphasizes that, rather than being mere supporting factors, Golgi pH, ion and redox homeostasis are in fact key players that orchestrate and maintain all Golgi functions.},

Results Here, we demonstrate that Rab30 is primarily associated with the secretory pathway, displaying predominant localisation to the Golgi apparatus. We find by time-lapse microscopy and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching studies that Rab30 is rapidly and continuously recruited to the Golgi. We also show that Rab30 function is required for the morphological integrity of the Golgi. Finally, we demonstrate that inactivation of Rab30 does not impair anterograde or retrograde transport through the Golgi. Conclusions Taken together, these data illustrate that Rab30 primarily localises to the Golgi apparatus and is required for the structural integrity of this organelle.},

  abstract = {The B subunit of verotoxin (VT1B) from enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli is responsible for the attachment of the holotoxin to the cell surface, by binding to the glycolipid, globotriaosyl ceramide. After receptor-mediated endocytosis, the toxin is targeted to the Golgi complex by a process of retrograde transport. We took advantage of this unique property of VT1B to measure the pH of the Golgi complex in intact live cells. Purified recombinant VT1B was labeled with either rhodamine or fluorescein for subcellular localization by confocal microscopy. After 1 h at 37 degrees C, VT1B accumulated in a juxtanuclear structure that colocalized with several Golgi markers, including alpha-mannosidase II, beta-COP, and NBD-ceramide. Moreover, colchicine and brefeldin A induced dispersal of the juxtanuclear staining, consistent with accumulation of VT1B in the Golgi complex. Imaging of the emission of fluorescein-labeled VT1B was used to measure intra-Golgi pH (pHG), which was calibrated in situ with ionophores. In intact Vero cells, pHG averaged 6.45 +/- 0.03 (standard error). The acidity of the Golgi lumen dissipated rapidly upon addition of bafilomycin A1, a blocker of vacuolar-type ATPases, pHG remained constant despite acidification of the cytosol by reversal of the plasmalemmal Na+/H+ antiport. Similarly, pHG was unaffected by acute changes in cytosolic calcium. Furthermore, pHG recovered quickly toward the basal level after departures imposed with weak bases. These findings suggest that pHG is actively regulated, despite the presence of a sizable H+ "leak" pathway. The ability of VT1B to target the Golgi complex should facilitate not only studies of acid-base regulation, but also analysis of other ionic species.},

However, little is known about the determinants and regulation of the pH in the secretory organelles, which cannot be readily accessed by [H+]-sensitive probes. We devised a procedure for the dynamic, noninvasive measurement of pH in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum in intact mammalian cells. A recombinant form of the B subunit of Shiga toxin, previously modified to include a carboxyl-terminal KDEL sequence and a pH-sensitive fluorophore, was used for a two-stage delivery strategy. Retrograde traffic of endogenous lipids was harnessed to target this protein to the Golgi complex, followed by retrieval to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by KDEL receptors. Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy were used to verify the subcellular localization of the modified B fragment. Fluorescence ratio imaging and two independent calibration procedures were applied to determine the pH of the ER in situ. We found that the pH of the endoplasmic reticulum is near neutral and is unaffected during agonist-induced release of calcium. The ER was found to be highly permeable to H+ (equivalents), so that the prevailing [H+] is susceptible to alterations in the cytosolic pH. Plasmalemmal acid-base transporters were shown to indirectly regulate the endoplasmic reticulum pH.},

A truncated form of (P)RR, termed M8.9, was also found to be associated with the vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase), implicating a non\textendash RAS-related function of ATP6AP2.Objective: We investigated the role of (P)RR/ATP6AP2 in murine cardiomyocytes.Methods and Results: Cardiomyocyte-specific ablation of Atp6ap2 resulted in lethal heart failure; the cardiomyocytes contained RAB7- and lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP2)-positive multivesicular vacuoles, especially in the perinuclear regions. The myofibrils and mitochondria remained at the cell periphery. Cardiomyocyte death was accompanied by numerous autophagic vacuoles that contained undigested cellular constituents, as a result of impaired autophagic degradation. Notably, ablation of Atp6ap2 selectively suppressed expression of the VO subunits of V-ATPase, resulting in deacidification of the intracellular vesicles. Furthermore, the inhibition of intracellular acidification by treatment with bafilomycin A1 or chloroquine reproduced the phenotype observed for the (P)RR/ATP6AP2-deficient cardiomyocytes.Conclusions: Genetic ablation of Atp6ap2 created a loss-of-function model for V-ATPase. The gene product of ATP6AP2 is considered to act as in 2 ways: (1) as (P)RR, exerting a RAS-related function; and (2) as the V-ATPase-associated protein, exerting a non\textendash RAS-related function that is essential for cell survival.},

Genetic deletion of ATP6AP2/PRR causes V-ATPase dysfunction and compromises vesicular acidification. Here, we characterized the domains of ATP6AP2/PRR involved in active V-ATPase biogenesis. Three forms of ATP6AP2/PRR were found intracellularly: full-length protein and the N- and C-terminal fragments of furin cleavage products, with the N-terminal fragment secreted extracellularly. Genetic deletion of ATP6AP2/PRR did not affect the protein stability of V-ATPase subunits. The extracellular domain (ECD) and transmembrane domain (TM) of ATP6AP2/PRR were indispensable for the biogenesis of active V-ATPase. A deletion mutant of ATP6AP2/PRR, which lacks exon 4-encoded amino acids inside the ECD ({$\Delta$}4M) and causes X-linked mental retardation Hedera type (MRXSH) and X-linked parkinsonism with spasticity (XPDS) in humans, was defective as a V-ATPase-associated protein. Prorenin had no effect on the biogenesis of active V-ATPase. The cleavage of ATP6AP2/PRR by furin seemed also dispensable for the biogenesis of active V-ATPase. We conclude that the N-terminal ECD of ATP6AP2/PRR, which is also involved in binding to prorenin or renin, is required for the biogenesis of active V-ATPase. The V-ATPase assembly occurs prior to its delivery to the trans-Golgi network and hence shedding of ATP6AP2/PRR would not affect the biogenesis of active V-ATPase.},

To reveal the mechanistic links between the v-H+-ATPase and MTORC1, we destablilized v-H+-ATPase complexes in mouse liver cells by induced deletion of the essential chaperone ATP6AP2. ATP6AP2-mutants are characterized by massive accumulation of endocytic and autophagic vacuoles in hepatocytes. This cellular phenotype was not caused by a block in endocytic maturation or an impaired acidification. However, the degradation of LC3-II in the knockout hepatocytes appeared to be reduced. When v-H+-ATPase levels were decreased, we observed lysosome association of MTOR and normal signaling of MTORC1 despite an increase in autophagic marker proteins. To better understand why MTORC1 can be active when v-H+-ATPase is depleted, the activation of MTORC1 was analyzed in ATP6AP2-deficient fibroblasts. In these cells, very little amino acid-elicited activation of MTORC1 was observed. In contrast, insulin did induce MTORC1 activation, which still required intracellular amino acid stores. These results suggest that in vivo the regulation of macroautophagy depends not only on v-H+-ATPase-mediated regulation of MTORC1.},

A typical mammalian Golgi consists of a pile of stapled cisternae, the Golgi stack, which is a key station for modification of newly synthesized proteins and lipids. Distinct stacks are interconnected by tubules to form the Golgi ribbon. At the entrance site of the Golgi, the cis-Golgi, vesicular tubular clusters (VTCs) form the intermediate between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi stack. At the exit site of the Golgi, the trans-Golgi, the trans-Golgi network (TGN) is the major site of sorting proteins to distinct cellular locations. Golgi functioning can only be understood in light of its complex architecture, as was revealed by a range of distinct electron microscopy (EM) approaches. In this article, a general concept of mammalian Golgi architecture, including VTCs and the TGN, is described.},

Analysis of his serum glycoproteins revealed defects in both sialylation and galactosylation of glycan termini. Trio-based whole-exome sequencing identified two heterozygous mutations in COG2: a de novo frameshift mutation [c.701dup (p.Tyr234*)] and a missense mutation [c.1900T {$>$} G (p.Trp634Gly)]. Sequencing of cloned reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) products revealed that both mutations were located on separate alleles, as expected, and that the mutant transcript harboring the frameshift mutation underwent degradation. The c.1900T {$>$} G (p.Trp634Gly) mutation is located in a domain highly conserved among vertebrates and was absent from both the public database and our control exomes. Protein expression of COG2, along with COG3 and COG4, was decreased in fibroblasts from the patient. Our data strongly suggest that these compound heterozygous mutations in COG2 are causative of CDG.},

While the species of accumulating proteins are distinct in each disease, an increasing body of evidence indicates that defects in the protein clearance system play a crucial role in the gradual accumulation of protein aggregates. Among protein degradation systems, the endosome-autophagosome-lysosome pathway (EALP) is the main degradation machinery, especially for large protein aggregates. Lysosomal dysfunction or defects in fusion with vesicles containing cargo are commonly observed abnormalities in proteinopathic neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we discuss the available evidence for a mechanistic connection between components of the EALP-especially lysosomes-and neurodegenerative diseases. We also focus on lysosomal pH regulation and its significance in maintaining flux through the EALP. Finally, we suggest that raising cAMP and free zinc levels in brain cells may be beneficial in normalizing lysosomal pH and EALP flux.},

  abstract = {Aberrant secretion of lysosomal hydrolases such as (pro)cathepsin D (proCD) is a common phenotypic change in many human cancers. Here we explore the underlying molecular defect(s) and find that MCF-7 breast and CaCo-2 colorectal cancer cells that are unable to acidify their endosomal compartments secreted higher amounts of proCD than did acidification-competent cancer cell types. The latter secreted equivalent amounts of proCD only after dissipation of their organellar pH gradients with NH(4)Cl. Assessing the critical steps that resulted in proCD secretion revealed that the Golgi-associated sorting receptor for CD, i.e. the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (MPR300), was aberrantly distributed in acidification-defective MCF-7 cells. It accumulated mainly in late endosomes and/or lysosomes as a complex with its ligand (proCD or intermediate CD), as evidenced by its co-localization with both CD and LAMP-2, a late endosome/lysosome marker. Our immunoprecipitation analyses also showed that MCF-7 cells possessed 7-fold higher levels of receptor-enzyme complexes than did acidification-competent cells. NH(4)Cl induced similar receptor redistribution into LAMP-2-positive structures in acidification-competent cells but not in MCF-7 cells. The receptor also recovered its normal Golgi localization upon drug removal. Based on these observations, we conclude that defective acidification results in the aberrant secretion of proCD in certain cancer cells and interferes mainly with the normal disassembly of the receptor-enzyme complexes and efficient receptor reutilization in the Golgi.},

  abstract = {Lysosomal hydrolases catalyze the degradation of a variety of macromolecules including proteins, carbohydrates, nucleic acids and lipids. The biogenesis of lysosomes or lysosome-related organelles requires a continuous substitution of soluble acid hydrolases and lysosomal membrane proteins. The targeting of lysosomal hydrolases depends on mannose 6-phosphate residues (M6P) that are recognized by specific receptors mediating their transport to an endosomal/prelysosomal compartment. The key role in the formation of M6P residues plays the GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase localized in the Golgi apparatus. Two genes have been identified recently encoding the type III {$\alpha$}/{$\beta$}-subunit precursor membrane protein and the soluble {$\gamma$}-subunit of GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase. Mutations in these genes result in two severe diseases, mucolipidosis type II (MLII) and III (MLIII), biochemically characterized by the missorting of multiple lysosomal hydrolases due to impaired formation of the M6P recognition marker, and general lysosomal dysfunction. This review gives an update on structural properties, localization and functions of the GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase subunits and improvements of pre- and postnatal diagnosis of ML patients. Further, the generation of recombinant single-chain antibody fragments against M6P residues and of new mouse models of MLII and MLIII will have considerable impact to provide deeper insight into the cell biology of lysosomal dysfunctions and the pathomechanisms underlying these lysosomal disorders.},

Giantin, the largest golgin in mammals, forms a complex with p115, rab1, GM130, and soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs), thereby facilitating vesicle tethering and fusion processes around the Golgi apparatus. Treatment with the microtubule destabilizing drug nocodazole transforms the Golgi ribbon into individual Golgi stacks. Here we show that siRNA-mediated depletion of giantin resulted in more dispersed Golgi stacks after nocodazole treatment than by control treatment, without changing the average cisternal length. Furthermore, depletion of giantin caused an increase in cargo transport that was associated with altered cell surface protein glycosylation. Drosophila S2 cells are known to have dispersed Golgi stacks and no giantin homolog. The exogenous expression of mammalian giantin cDNA in S2 cells resulted in clustered Golgi stacks, similar to the Golgi ribbon in mammalian cells. These results suggest that the spatial organization of the Golgi ribbon is mediated by giantin, which also plays a role in cargo transport and sugar modifications.},

  abstract = {The mechanism of initiation of translation differs between prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and the strategies used for regulation differ accordingly. Translation in prokaryotes is usually regulated by blocking access to the initiation site. This is accomplished via base-paired structures (within the mRNA itself, or between the mRNA and a small trans-acting RNA) or via mRNA-binding proteins. Classic examples of each mechanism are described. The polycistronic structure of mRNAs is an important aspect of translational control in prokaryotes, but polycistronic mRNAs are not usable (and usually not produced) in eukaryotes. Four structural elements in eukaryotic mRNAs are important for regulating translation: (i) the m7G cap; (ii) sequences flanking the AUG start codon; (iii) the position of the AUG codon relative to the 5{${'}$} end of the mRNA; and (iv) secondary structure within the mRNA leader sequence. The scanning model provides a framework for understanding these effects. The scanning mechanism also explains how small open reading frames near the 5{${'}$} end of the mRNA can down-regulate translation. This constraint is sometimes abrogated by changing the structure of the mRNA, sometimes with clinical consequences. Examples are described. Some mistaken ideas about regulation of translation that have found their way into textbooks are pointed out and corrected.},

Using yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation approaches, we show that the COG6 subunit of the COG complex is capable of interacting with a subset of Golgi SNAREs, namely STX5, STX6, GS27 and SNAP29. Interaction with SNAREs is accomplished via the universal SNARE-binding motif of COG6. Overexpression of COG6, or its depletion from cells, disrupts the integrity of the Golgi complex. Importantly, COG6 protein lacking the SNARE-binding domain is deficient in Golgi binding, and is not capable of inducing Golgi complex fragmentation when overexpressed. These results indicate that COG6-SNARE interactions are important for both COG6 localization and Golgi integrity.},

The reconstruction shown here ({$\sim$}1 \texttimes{} 1 \texttimes{} 4 {$\mu$}m3) contains two stacks of seven cisternae separated by a noncompact region across which bridges connect some cisternae at equivalent levels, but none at nonequivalent levels. The rest of the noncompact region is filled with both vesicles and polymorphic membranous elements. All cisternae are fenestrated and display coated buds. They all have about the same surface area, but they differ in volume by as much as 50\%. The trans-most cisterna produces exclusively clathrin-coated buds, whereas the others display only nonclathrin coated buds. This finding challenges traditional views of where sorting occurs within the Golgi complex. Tubules with budding profiles extend from the margins of both cis and trans cisternae. They pass beyond neighboring cisternae, suggesting that these tubules contribute to traffic to and/or from the Golgi. Vesicle-filled ``wells'' open to both the cis and lateral sides of the stacks. The stacks of cisternae are positioned between two types of ER, cis and trans. The cis ER lies adjacent to the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment, which consists of discrete polymorphic membranous elements layered in front of the cis-most Golgi cisterna. The extensive trans ER forms close contacts with the two trans-most cisternae; this apposition may permit direct transfer of lipids between ER and Golgi membranes. Within 0.2 {$\mu$}m of the cisternae studied, there are 394 vesicles (8 clathrin coated, 190 nonclathrin coated, and 196 noncoated), indicating considerable vesicular traffic in this Golgi region. Our data place structural constraints on models of trafficking to, through, and from the Golgi complex.},

In this study, we carried out mutagenesis screening in mice to identify new regulators of palatogenesis. Through genetic linkage mapping and whole-exome sequencing, we identified a loss-of-function mutation in the Golgb1 gene that co-segregated with cleft palate in a new mutant mouse line. Golgb1 is a ubiquitously expressed large coiled-coil protein, also known as giantin, that is localized at the Golgi membrane. Using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing, we generated and analyzed developmental defects in mice carrying additional Golgb1 loss-of-function mutations, which supported a crucial requirement for Golgb1 in palate development. Through maxillary explant culture assays, we demonstrate that the Golgb1 mutant embryos have intrinsic defects in palatal shelf elevation. Just prior to the developmental stage of palatal shelf elevation in wild-type littermates, Golgb1 mutant embryos exhibit increased cell density, reduced hyaluronan accumulation and impaired protein glycosylation in the palatal mesenchyme. Together, these results demonstrate that, although it is a ubiquitously expressed Golgi-associated protein, Golgb1 has specific functions in protein glycosylation and tissue morphogenesis.},

This capability is possibly mediated by multiple direct interactions of COG subunits and specific Golgi SNAREs and SM (Sec1/Munc18) proteins. By using a systematic co-immunoprecipitation analysis, we identified seven new interactions between the COG subunits and components of the Golgi fusion machinery in mammalian cells. Our studies suggest that these multivalent interactions are critical for the assembly of fusogenic SNARE complexes on the Golgi apparatus and consequently for facilitating endosome-to-trans-Golgi network (TGN) and intra-Golgi retrograde transport, and also for coordinating these transport routes.},

N-glycans of misfolded glycoproteins are then more extensively trimmed than once thought, being targeted for degradation by removal of three or four mannose residues. A high local concentration of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) mannosidase I in an ER-derived quality control compartment is mainly responsible for this trimming, with the possible participation of other mannosidases.

We tested the hypothesis that Niemann-Pick type C 1 (NPC1) protein aids the transfer of low density lipoprotein-derived cholesterol across this glycocalyx. A prediction of this model is that cells will be less dependent upon NPC1 if their glycocalyx is decreased in density. Lysosome cholesterol content was significantly lower after treatment of NPC1-deficient human fibroblasts with benzyl-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-{$\alpha$}-D-galactopyranoside, an inhibitor of O-linked glycosylation. Direct biochemical measurement of cholesterol showed that lysosomes purified from NPC1-deficient fibroblasts contained at least 30\% less cholesterol when O-linked glycosylation was blocked. As an independent means to modify protein glycosylation, we used Chinese hamster ovary ldl-D cells defective in UDP-Gal/UDP-GalNAc 4-epimerase in which N- and O-linked glycosylation can be controlled. CRISPR generated, NPC1-deficient ldl-D cells supplemented with galactose accumulated more cholesterol than those in which sugar addition was blocked. In the absence of galactose supplementation, NPC1-deficient ldl-D cells also transported more cholesterol from lysosomes to the endoplasmic reticulum, as monitored by an increase in cholesteryl [14C]-oleate levels. These experiments support a model in which NPC1 protein functions to transfer cholesterol past a lysosomal glycocalyx.},

Here we describe a systematic, structure-based mutational analysis of the yeast SM protein Sly1p, which was previously shown to function in anterograde endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-to-Golgi and intra-Golgi protein transport. Five new temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants, each carrying a single amino acid substitution in Sly1p, were identified. Unexpectedly, not all of the ts mutants exhibited striking anterograde ER-to-Golgi transport defects. For example, in cells of the novel sly1-5 mutant, transport of newly synthesized lysosomal and secreted proteins was still efficient, but the ER-resident Kar2p/BiP was missorted to the outside of the cell, and two proteins, Sed5p and Rer1p, which normally shuttle between the Golgi and the ER, failed to relocate to the ER. We also discovered that in vivo, Sly1p was associated with a SNARE complex formed on the ER, and that in vitro, the SM protein directly interacted with the ER-localized nonsyntaxin SNAREs Use1p/Slt1p and Sec20p. Furthermore, several conditional mutants defective in Golgi-to-ER transport were synthetically lethal with sly1-5. Together, these results indicate a previously unrecognized function of Sly1p in retrograde transport to the endoplasmic reticulum.},

Regulated assembly of V1 and V0 represents an important regulatory mechanism for controlling V-ATPase activity in vivo. Previous work has shown that V-ATPase assembly increases during maturation of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells induced by activation of Toll-like receptors. This increased assembly is essential for antigen processing, which is dependent upon an acidic lysosomal pH. Cluster disruption of dendritic cells induces a semi-mature phenotype associated with immune tolerance. Thus, semi-mature dendritic cells are able to process and present self-peptides to suppress autoimmune responses. We have investigated V-ATPase assembly in bone marrow-derived, murine dendritic cells and observed an increase in assembly following cluster disruption. This increased assembly is not dependent upon new protein synthesis and is associated with an increase in concanamycin A-sensitive proton transport in FITC-loaded lysosomes. Inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase with wortmannin or mTORC1 with rapamycin effectively inhibits the increased assembly observed upon cluster disruption. These results suggest that the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/mTOR pathway is involved in controlling V-ATPase assembly during dendritic cell maturation.},

  abstract = {The retrograde transport pathways from early/recycling endosomes are critical for recycling a range of endogenous cargo, as well as internalisation of bacterial and plant toxins. We have previously shown that the retrograde transport of the two model cargos, TGN38 and Shiga toxin, differs in the requirement for TGN golgins; transport of TGN38 requires the TGN golgin GCC88 whereas that of Shiga toxin requires GCC185. Here we have further defined the retrograde transport requirements of these two cargos. Tracking the transport of these cargos demonstrated that the bulk of Shiga toxin is transported from early endosomes to recycling endosomes en route to the TGN whereas the bulk of TGN38 is transported from early endosomes to the TGN with only low levels detected in recycling endosomes. In cells depleted of the TGN t-SNARE syntaxin 16, TGN38 accumulated predominantly in early endosomes whereas Shiga toxin accumulated in Rab11-positive recycling endosomes, suggesting distinct routes for each cargo. Retrograde transport of Shiga toxin and TGN38 requires retromer, however, whereas sorting nexin 1 (SNX1) is specifically required for transport of Shiga toxin, sorting nexin 2 (SNX2) is required for the transport of TGN38. Overall, our data have identified different itineraries for the retrograde transport of Shiga toxin and TGN38 and distinct retromer components that regulate the transport of these cargos.},

  abstract = {Background The regulation and maintenance of intracellular pH are critical to diverse metabolic functions of the living cells. Fluorescence time-resolved techniques and instrumentations have advanced rapidly and enabled the imaging of intracellular pH based on the fluorescence lifetimes. Methods The frequency-domain fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) and fluorophores displaying appropriate pH-dependent lifetime sensitivities were used to determine the temporal and spatial pH distributions in the cytosol and vesicular compartment lysosomes. Results We found that cytosolic pH levels are different in 3T3 fibroblasts, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, and MCF-7 cells when using the pH probe carboxy-SNAFL2. We also tracked the transient cytosolic pH changes in the living CHO cells after treatments with proton pump inhibitors, ion exchanger inhibitors, and weak base and acid. The intracellular lysosomal pH was determined with the acidic lifetime probes DM-NERF dextrans, OG-514 carboxylic acid dextrans, and LysoSensor DND-160. Our results showed that the resting lysosomal pH value obtained from the 3T3 fibroblasts was between 4.5 and 4.9. The increase of lysosomal pH induced by the treatments with proton pump inhibitor and ionophores also were observed in our FLIM measurements. Conclusions Our lifetime-based pH imaging data suggested that FLIM can measure the intracellular pH of the resting cells and follow the pH fluctuations inside the cells after environmental perturbations. To improve the z-axis resolution to the intracellular lifetime-resolved images, we are investigating the implementation of the pseudo-confocal capability to our current FLIM apparatus.

  abstract = {The SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) protein syntaxin-5 (Stx5) is essential for Golgi transport. In humans, the STX5 mRNA encodes two protein isoforms, Stx5 Long (Stx5L) from the first starting methionine and Stx5 Short (Stx5S) from an alternative starting methionine at position 55. In this study, we identified a novel human disorder caused by a single missense substitution in the second starting methionine (p.M55V), resulting in complete loss of the short isoform. Patients suffer from an early fatal multisystem disease, including severe liver disease, skeletal abnormalities and abnormal glycosylation. Whereas Golgi morphology was unaltered, primary human dermal fibroblasts isolated from these patients showed defective glycosylation and mislocalization of glycosyltransferases. Measurements of anterograde trafficking, based on biotin-synchronizable forms of Stx5 (the RUSH system), and of cognate binding SNAREs, based on F\"orster resonance energy transfer (FRET), revealed that the short isoform of Stx5 is essential for intra-Golgi transport. This is the first time a mutation in an alternative starting codon is linked to human disease, demonstrating that the site of translation initiation is an important new layer of regulating protein trafficking.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementN.H.R. is funded by a Long-Term Fellowship from the European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO-LTF, ALTF 232-2016) and a Veni grant from the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (016.VENI.171.097).

  abstract = {Many cellular processes are dependent on correct pH levels, and this is especially important for the secretory pathway. Defects in pH homeostasis in distinct organelles cause a wide range of diseases, including disorders of glycosylation and lysosomal storage diseases. Ratiometric imaging of the pH-sensitive mutant of green fluorescent protein (GFP), pHLuorin, has allowed for targeted pH measurements in various organelles, but the required sequential image acquisition is intrinsically slow and therefore the temporal resolution unsuitable to follow the rapid transit of cargo between organelles. We therefore applied fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) to measure intraorganellar pH with just a single excitation wavelength. We first validated this method by confirming the pH in multiple compartments along the secretory pathway. Then, we analyze the dynamic pH changes within cells treated with Brefeldin A, a COPI coat inhibitor. Finally, we followed the pH changes of newly-synthesized molecules of the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-{$\alpha$} while it was in transit from the endoplasmic reticulum via the Golgi to the plasma membrane. The toolbox we present here can be applied to measure intracellular pH with high spatial and temporal resolution, and can be used to assess organellar pH in disease models.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Stx5 and Sed5p are structurally highly conserved and are both regulated by interactions with other ER-Golgi SNARE proteins, the Sec1/Munc18-like protein Scfd1/Sly1p and the membrane tethering complexes COG, p115, and GM130. Despite these similarities, yeast Sed5p and mammalian Stx5 are differently recruited to COPII-coated vesicles, and Stx5 interacts with the microtubular cytoskeleton, whereas Sed5p does not. In this review, we argue that these different Stx5 interactions contribute to structural differences in ER-Golgi transport between mammalian and yeast cells. Insight into the function of Stx5 is important given its essential role in the secretory pathway of eukaryotic cells and its involvement in infections and neurodegenerative diseases.},

  abstract = {Glycosylation is an important post-translational modification for both intracellular and secreted proteins. For glycosylation to occur, cargo must be transported after synthesis through the different compartments of the Golgi apparatus where distinct monosaccharides are sequentially bound and trimmed, resulting in increasingly complex branched glycan structures. Of utmost importance for this process is the intraorganellar environment of the Golgi. Each Golgi compartment has a distinct pH, which is maintained by the vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase). Moreover, tethering factors such as Golgins and the conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex, in concert with coatomer (COPI) and soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE)-mediated membrane fusion, efficiently deliver glycosylation enzymes to the right Golgi compartment. Together, these factors maintain intra-Golgi trafficking of proteins involved in glycosylation and thereby enable proper glycosylation. However, pathogenic mutations in these factors can cause defective glycosylation and lead to diseases with a wide variety of symptoms such as liver dysfunction and skin and bone disorders. Collectively, this group of disorders is known as congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG). Recent technological advances have enabled the robust identification of novel CDGs related to membrane trafficking components. In this review, we highlight differences and similarities between membrane trafficking-related CDGs.},

The probe exhibits intense red fluorescence in acidic organelles or the acidified cytosol while exhibiting~negligible fluorescence in other regions of the cell.

Here we show that the N-terminal cytoplasmic tails (N-tails) of a number of cis Golgi glycosyltransferases which share a {$\phi$}-(K/R)-X-L-X-(K/R) sequence bind directly to the {$\delta$}- and {$\zeta$}-subunits of COPI. Mutations of this N-tail motif impair binding to the COPI subunits, leading to mislocalization of the transferases to lysosomes. The physiological importance of these interactions is illustrated by mucolipidosis III patients with missense mutations in the N-tail of GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase that cause the transferase to be rapidly degraded in lysosomes. These studies establish that direct binding of the N-tails of mammalian cis Golgi glycosyltransferases with COPI subunits is essential for recycling within the Golgi.},

PMLD is characterized by early-onset nystagmus, delayed development (motor delay, speech delay and dysarthria), dystonia, hypotonia typically evolving into spasticity, ataxia, seizures, optic atrophy, and diffuse leukodystrophy on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We identified a 12-year-old Caucasian/Hispanic male with the classical clinical characteristics of PMLD with lack of myelination of the subcortical white matter, and absence of the splenium of corpus callosum. Exome sequencing in the trio revealed novel compound heterozygous pathogenic mutations in SNAP29 (p.Leu119AlafsX15, c.354DupG and p.0?, c.2T\,{$>$}\,C). Quantitative analysis of the patient's blood cells through RNA sequencing identified a significant decrease in SNAP29 mRNA expression, while western blot analysis on fibroblast cells revealed a lack of protein expression compared to parental and control cells. Mutations in SNAP29 have previously been associated with cerebral dysgenesis, neuropathy, ichthyosis, and keratoderma (CEDNIK) syndrome. Typical skin features described in CEDNIK syndrome, such as generalized ichthyosis and keratoderma, were absent in our patient. Moreover, the early onset nystagmus and leukodystrophy were consistent with a PMLD diagnosis. These findings suggest that loss of SNAP29 function, which was previously associated with CEDNIK syndrome, is also associated with PMLD. Overall, our study expands the genetic spectrum of PMLD.},

However, measurements of organelle pH in living cells have been scarce. Several mutants of the Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein (GFP) displayed a pH-dependent absorbance and fluorescent emission, with apparent pKa values ranging from 6.15 (mutations F64L/S65T/H231L) and 6.4 (K26R/F64L/S65T/Y66W/N146I/M153T/ V163A/N164H/H231L) to a remarkable 7.1 (S65G/S72A/T203Y/H231L). We have targeted these GFPs to the cytosol plus nucleus, the medial/trans-Golgi by fusion with galactosyltransferase, and the mitochondrial matrix by using the targeting signal from subunit IV of cytochrome c oxidase. Cells in culture transfected with these cDNAs displayed the expected subcellular localization by light and electron microscopy and reported local pH that was calibrated in situ with ionophores. We monitored cytosolic and nuclear pH of HeLa cells, and mitochondrial matrix pH in HeLa cells and in rat neonatal cardiomyocytes. The pH of the medial/trans-Golgi was measured at steady-state (calibrated to be 6.58 in HeLa cells) and after various manipulations. These demonstrated that the Golgi membrane in intact cells is relatively permeable to H+, and that Cl- serves as a counter-ion for H+ transport and likely helps to maintain electroneutrality. The amenability to engineer GFPs to specific subcellular locations or tissue targets using gene fusion and transfer techniques should allow us to examine pH at sites previously inaccessible.},

  abstract = {Secretory and endolysosomal fusion events are driven by SNAREs and cofactors, including Sec17/{$\alpha$}-SNAP, Sec18/NSF, and Sec1/Munc18 (SM) proteins. SMs are essential for fusion in vivo, but the basis of this requirement is enigmatic. We now report that, in addition to their established roles as fusion accelerators, SM proteins Sly1 and Vps33 directly shield SNARE complexes from Sec17- and Sec18-mediated disassembly. In vivo, wild-type Sly1 and Vps33 function are required to withstand overproduction of Sec17. In vitro, Sly1 and Vps33 impede SNARE complex disassembly by Sec18 and ATP. Unexpectedly, Sec17 directly promotes selective loading of Sly1 and Vps33 onto cognate SNARE complexes. A large thermodynamic barrier limits SM binding, implying that significant conformational rearrangements are involved. In a working model, Sec17 and SMs accelerate fusion mediated by cognate SNARE complexes and protect them from NSF-mediated disassembly, while mis-assembled or non-cognate SNARE complexes are eliminated through kinetic proofreading by Sec18.},

Over the past decade, significant progress has been made in the understanding of the cellular pathways and mechanisms involved in lipoplex-mediated gene transfection but the interaction of cationic lipids with cell components and the consequences of such an interaction on cell physiology remains poorly described. The data reported in the present review provide evidence that cationic lipids are not just carriers for molecular delivery into cells but do modify cellular pathways and stimulate immune or anti-inflammatory responses. Considering the wide number of cationic lipids currently available and the variety of cellular components that could be involved, it is likely that only a few cationic lipid-dependent functions have been identified so far.},

Supplementation of biotin competitively disrupts the interaction between the SBP moiety and streptavidin, liberating the chimeric target protein from its hooks, while addition of avidin causes the removal of biotin from the system and reestablishes the interaction. Based on this principle, we engineered two chimeric proteins involved in autophagy, namely microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3B (MAP1LC3B, best known as LC3) and sequestosome-1 (SQSTM1, best known as p62) to move them as SBP\textendash GFP\textendash LC3 and p62\textendash SBP\textendash GFP at will between the cytosol and two different organelles, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus. Although both proteins were functional in thus far that SBP\textendash GFP\textendash LC3 and p62\textendash SBP\textendash GFP could recruit their endogenous binding partners, p62 and LC3, respectively, their enforced relocation to the ER or Golgi failed to induce organelle-specific autophagy. Hence, artificial tethering of LC3 or p62 to the surface of the ER and the Golgi is not sufficient to trigger autophagy.},

  abstract = {The golgins comprise a family of vesicle tethering proteins that act in a selective manner to tether transport vesicles at the Golgi apparatus. Tethering is followed by membrane fusion to complete the delivery of vesicle-bound cargo to the Golgi. Different golgins are localized to different regions of the Golgi, and their ability to selectively tether transport vesicles is important for the specificity of vesicle traffic in the secretory pathway. In recent years, our mechanistic understanding of golgin-mediated tethering has greatly improved. We are also beginning to appreciate how the loss of golgin function can impact upon physiological processes through the use of animal models and the study of human disease. These approaches have revealed that loss of a golgin causes tissue-restricted phenotypes, which can vary in severity and the cell types affected. In many cases, it is possible to attribute these phenotypes to a defect in vesicular traffic, although why certain tissues are sensitive to loss of a particular golgin is still, in most cases, unclear. Here, I will summarize recent progress in our understanding of golgins, focusing on the physiological roles of these proteins, as determined from animal models and the study of disease in humans. I will describe what these in vivo analyses have taught us, as well as highlight less understood aspects, and areas for future investigations.},

Current synthetic DNA delivery systems are versatile and safe, but substantially less efficient than viruses. Indeed, most current systems address only one of the obstacles to DNA delivery by enhancing DNA uptake. In fact, the effectiveness of gene expression is also dependent on several additional factors, including the release of intracellular DNA, stability of DNA in the cytoplasm, unpackaging of the DNA\textendash vector complex, and the targeting of DNA to the nucleus. Delivery systems of the future must fully accommodate all these processes to effectively shepherd DNA across the plasma membrane, through the hostile intracellular environment, and into the nucleus.},

  abstract = {Luminal pH is an important functional feature of intracellular organelles. Acidification of the lumen of organelles such as endosomes, lysosomes, and the Golgi apparatus plays a critical role in fundamental cellular processes. As such, measurement of the luminal pH of these organelles has relevance to both basic research and translational research. At the same time, accurate measurement of intraorganellar pH in living cells can be challenging and may be a limiting hurdle for research in some areas. Here we describe three powerful methods to measure rigorously the luminal pH of different intracellular organelles, focusing on endosomes, lysosomes, and the Golgi apparatus. The described methods are based on live imaging of pH-sensitive fluorescent probes and include: (1) A protocol based on quantitative, ratiometric measurement of endocytosis of pH-sensitive and pH-insensitive fluorescent conjugates of transferrin; (2) A protocol for the use of proteins tagged with a ratiometric variant of the pH-sensitive intrinsically fluorescent protein pHluorin; and (3) A protocol using the fluorescent dye LysoSensor\texttrademark. We describe necessary reagents, key procedures, and methods and equipment for data acquisition and analysis. Examples of implementation of the protocols are provided for cultured cells derived from a cancer cell line and for primary cultures of mouse hippocampal neurons. In addition, we present strengths and weaknesses of the different described intraorganellar pH measurement methods. These protocols are likely to be of benefit to many researchers, from basic scientists to those conducting translational research with a focus on diseases in patient-derived cells.},

The pH values of trans-Golgi network (pHTGN) and recycling endosomes (pHRE) were measured by transfecting H+/K+-alpha,beta cells with the pH-sensitive GFP pHluorin fused to targeting sequences of either TGN38 or synaptobrevin, respectively. Immunofluorescence showed that H+/K+-ATPase was present in the plasma membrane, TGN, and RE. The pHTGN was similar in both H+/K+-alpha,beta cells (pHTGN 6.36) and vector-transfected ("mock") cells (pHTGN 6.34); pHRE was also similar in H+/K+-alpha,beta (pHRE 6.40) and mock cells (pHRE 6.37). SCH28080 (inhibits H+/K+-ATPase) caused TGN to alkalinize by 0.12 pH units; subsequent addition of bafilomycin (inhibits H+ v-ATPase) caused TGN to alkalinize from pH 6.4 up to a new steady-state pHTGN of 7.0-7.5, close to pHcytosol. Similar results were observed in RE. Thus H+/K+-ATPases that trafficked to the plasma membrane were active but had small effects to acidify the TGN and RE compared with H+ v-ATPase. Mathematical modeling predicted a large number of H+ v-ATPases (8000) active in the TGN to balance a large, passive H+ leak (with PH approximately 10-3 cm/s) via unidentified pathways out of the TGN. We propose that in the presence of this effective, though inefficient, buffer system in the Golgi and TGN, H+/K+-ATPases (estimated to be approximately 4000 active in the TGN) and other transporters have little effect on luminal pH as they traffic to the plasma membrane.},

It is required for membrane budding at a late stage during the transition from a fully formed pit to a pinched-off vesicle. Dynamin may also fulfill other roles during earlier stages of vesicle formation. We have screened about 16,000 small molecules and have identified 1, named here dynasore, that interferes in vitro with the GTPase activity of dynamin1, dynamin2, and Drp1, the mitochondrial dynamin, but not of other small GTPases. Dynasore acts as a potent inhibitor of endocytic pathways known to depend on dynamin by rapidly blocking coated vesicle formation within seconds of dynasore addition. Two types of coated pit intermediates accumulate during dynasore treatment, {$\cup$}-shaped, half formed pits and O-shaped, fully formed pits, captured while pinching off. Thus, dynamin acts at two steps during clathrin coat formation; GTP hydrolysis is probably needed at both steps.},

  abstract = {Proteins and glycolipids are modified by various modes of glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus. It is well known that the lumen of the Golgi is acidic and compromising acidification by chemical compounds causes impaired glycosylation and transport of proteins (Axelsson et al., 2001, Chapman \& Munro, 1994, Palokangas et al., 1994, Presley et al., 1997; Puri et al., 2002; Reaves and Banting, 1994; Rivinoja et al., 2006; Tartakoff et al., 1978). The mechanisms by which glycosylation and transport are regulated by an acidic pH remain largely unknown. Recent findings that the impaired regulation of an acidic environment may be implicated in the pathology of several diseases emphasize the importance of pH regulation (Jentsch, 2007, Kasper et al., 2005, Kornak et al., 2001, Kornak et al., 2008, Piwon et al., 2000, Stobrawa et al., 2001, Teichgraber et al., 2008). We recently established a mutant cell line in which Golgi acidification was selectively impaired and the raised luminal Golgi pH caused impaired transport and glycosylation of proteins and altered Golgi morphology (Maeda et al., 2008). As alkalinizing compounds nonselectively affect all acidic organelles including lysosomes, endosomes, and the Golgi, the mutant cell is thought to be useful in analyzing how the acidic environment of the Golgi regulates glycosylation. In this chapter, we have introduced how we established mutant cells with impaired Golgi acidification and methods for measuring Golgi pH.},

GFP2, a GFP variant that contains mammalianized codons and the folding enhancing mutation F64L, displays \textasciitilde 8-fold higher florescence compared to pHluorin upon excitation at 395 nm. Using GFP2 as a template, an enhanced ratiometric pHluorin (pHluo-rin2) construct was developed to contain fully mam-malianized codons, the F64L mutation and ten of the thirteen pHluorin-specific mutations. As a result, pH-luorin2 displays markedly higher florescence when compared to pHluorin while maintaining the rati-ometric pH-sensitivity. Unlike native pHluorin, pH-luorin2 expressed in the ligand-binding domain of the parathyroid hormone 1 receptor is readily detectable by confocal microscopy and displays a marked in-crease in florescence upon ligand-induced endocyto-sis to intracellular vesicles. Thus, pHluorin2 displays enhanced florescence while sustaining ratiometric pH-sensitivity, representing a significant improvement for this methodological approach.},

  abstract = {The Saccharomyces cerevisiae vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) is a multisubunit complex composed of a peripheral membrane sector (V1) responsible for ATP hydrolysis and an integral membrane sector (V0) required for proton translocation. Biogenesis of V0 requires an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized accessory factor, Vma21p. We found that in vma21Delta cells, the major proteolipid subunit of V0 failed to interact with the 100-kDa V0 subunit, Vph1p, indicating that Vma21p is necessary for V0 assembly. Immunoprecipitation of Vma21p from wild-type membranes resulted in coimmunoprecipitation of all five V0 subunits. Analysis of vmaDelta strains showed that binding of V0 subunits to Vma21p was mediated by the proteolipid subunit Vma11p. Although Vma21p/proteolipid interactions were independent of Vph1p, Vma21p/Vph1p association was dependent on all other V0 subunits, indicating that assembly of V0 occurs in a defined sequence, with Vph1p recruitment into a Vma21p/proteolipid/Vma6p complex representing the final step. An in vitro assay for ER export was used to demonstrate preferential packaging of the fully assembled Vma21p/proteolipid/Vma6p/Vph1p complex into COPII-coated transport vesicles. Pulse-chase experiments showed that the interaction between Vma21p and V0 was transient and that Vma21p/V0 dissociation was concomitant with V0/V1 assembly. Blocking ER export in vivo stabilized the interaction between Vma21p and V0 and abrogated assembly of V0/V1. Although a Vma21p mutant lacking an ER-retrieval signal remained associated with V0 in the vacuole, this interaction did not affect the assembly of vacuolar V0/V1 complexes. We conclude that Vma21p is not involved in regulating the interaction between V0 and V1 sectors, but that it has a crucial role in coordinating the assembly of V0 subunits and in escorting the assembled V0 complex into ER-derived transport vesicles.},

The function of Rab6a' was also required, whereas its closely related isoform, Rab6a, has previously been implicated in Golgi-to-endoplasmic reticulum transport. Thus, our study shows that membrane exchange between the early endocytic and the biosynthetic/secretory pathways involves specific components of the Rab and SNARE machinery, and suggests that retrograde transport between early/recycling endosomes and the endoplasmic reticulum is critically dependent on the sequential action of two members of the Rab6 subfamily.},

In this study, we combined X-ray crystallographic and biochemical analysis with functional assays of cargo packaging into COPII vesicles to establish molecular mechanisms for cargo discrimination by human Sec24 subunits. A conserved IxM packaging signal binds in a surface groove of Sec24c and Sec24d, but the groove is occluded in the Sec24a and Sec24b subunits. Conversely, LxxLE class transport signals and the DxE signal of VSV glycoprotein are selectively bound by Sec24a and Sec24b subunits. A comparative analysis of crystal structures of the four human Sec24 isoforms establishes the structural determinants for discrimination among these transport signals, and provides a framework to understand how an expansion of coat subunits extends the range of cargo proteins packaged into COPII-coated vesicles.},

  abstract = {The Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene, VPH1 (Vacuolar pH 1), encodes a 95-kDa integral membrane subunit of the vacuolar-type H(+)-ATPase (V-ATPase) that is required for enzyme assembly; disruption of the VPH1 gene impairs vacuolar acidification (Manolson, M.F., Proteau, D., Preston, R. A., Stenbit, A., Roberts, B. T., Hoyt, M. A., Preuss, D., Mulholland, J., Botstein, D., and Jones, E. W. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 14294-14303). Here we show that STV1 (Similar To VPH1) encodes an integral membrane polypeptide of 102 kDa with 54\% identity with the peptide sequence of Vph1p. High copy expression of STV1 partially restores vacuolar acidification in a delta vph1 mutant strain; solubilization and fractionation of membrane proteins from these vacuoles show that Stv1p co-purifies with bafilomycin A1-sensitive ATPase activity and with the 60- and 69-kDa V-ATPase subunits. Immunofluorescence microscopy of strains bearing a single copy of epitope-tagged STV1 reveals punctate staining of the cytoplasm; overexpression of epitope-tagged Stv1p reveals both punctate cytoplasmic staining and vacuolar membrane staining. Northern analysis shows that disruption of STV1 does not affect the level of transcription of VPH1 and that disruption of VPH1 does not affect the level of transcription of STV1. Strains bearing disruption of genes encoding other V-ATPase subunits (VMA1, VMA2, VMA3, and VMA4) fail to grow on media supplemented with 100 mM CaCl2 or 4 mM ZnCl2, media buffered to pH 7.5, or media with a glycerol carbon source. On the same types of media only a delta vph1 delta stv1 double disruption mutant has growth phenotypes equivalent to strains bearing a single disruption of the VMA1, VMA2, VMA3, and VMA4 genes; a delta vph1 strain has only moderate growth inhibition while a delta stv1 strain has wild type growth on the conditions listed above. We conclude that Stv1p is a functional homologue of Vph1p and suggest that Stv1p and Vph1p may be equivalent subunits for V-ATPases located on different organelles. The function of these 100-kDa homologues may be to target or regulate other common V-ATPase subunits for two distinct cellular locations.},

We have used imaging techniques to understand the relationship between the cis-medial Golgi matrix and transmembrane proteins during retrograde traffic in control and brefeldin A (BFA)-treated cells. All five of the cis-medial matrix proteins tested were associated with retrograde tubules within 2-3 min of initiation of tubule formation. Then, at later time points (3-10 min), transmembrane proteins are apparent in the same tubules. Strikingly, both the matrix proteins and the transmembrane proteins moved directly to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit sites labeled with p58 and Sec13, and there seemed to be a specific interaction between the ER exit sites and the tips or branch points of the tubules enriched for the matrix proteins. After the initial interaction, Golgi matrix proteins accumulated rapidly (5-10 min) at ER exit sites, and Golgi transmembrane proteins accumulated at the same sites {$\sim$}2 h later. Our data suggest that Golgi cis-medial matrix proteins participate in Golgi-to-ER traffic and play a novel role in tubule formation and targeting.},

The regulation of V-ATPases by signalling pathways has been demonstrated in various model systems. However, little is known about signalling-regulated V-ATPase activation during IAV infection. Here we show that V-ATPase activity is elevated during infection of cell monolayers with IAV, as measured by intracellular pH change, via a mechanism mediated by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). Inhibition of IAV-induced early activation of these kinases reduced V-ATPase activity and the acidification of intracellular compartments in infected cells. IAV-activated ERK and PI3K appear to interact directly, and they colocalize with the E subunit of V-ATPase V1 domain. Further, siRNAs targeting the E2 subunit isoform significantly reduced virus titres. Interestingly, suppression of PI3K early activation, but not that of ERK or V-ATPase, negatively affected virus internalization, suggesting the involvement of the pathway in earlier, V-ATPase-independent infection-promoting events. Cell treatment with a V-ATPase-specific inhibitor impaired the nuclear localization of incoming viral ribonucleoproteins, inhibiting replication/transcription of viral RNAs. These findings highlight the importance of IAV-induced ERK and PI3K early activation as signalling mediators in V-ATPase-stimulated endosomal acidification required for fusion.},

Development delay, neurological, and other clinical abnormalities as well as various non-specific laboratory changes can lead to the first suspicion of the disease. Still common screening test for most CDG types, including CDG Ia, is isoelectric focusing/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (IEF). IEF demonstrates the hypoglycosylation of various glycoproteins, usually serum transferrin. Other methods, such as agarose electrophoresis, capillary electrophoresis, high-performance liquid chromatography, micro-column separation combined with turbidimetry, enzyme-(EIA) and radioimmunoassay (RIA) have also been used for screening. However, these methods do not recognize all CDG defects, so other approaches including analysis of membrane-linked markers and urine oligosaccharides should be taken. Confirmation of diagnosis and detailed CDG subtyping starts with thorough structure analysis of the affected lipid-linked oligosaccharide or protein-(peptide)-linked-glycan using metabolic labeling and various (possibly mass-spectrometry combined) techniques. Decreased enzyme activity in peripheral leukocytes/cultured fibroblasts or analysis of affected transporters and other functional proteins combined with identification of specific gene mutations confirm the diagnosis. Prenatal diagnosis, based on enzyme assay or mutation analysis, is also available. Peri-/post-mortem investigations of fatal cases are important for genetic counseling. Evaluation of various analytical approaches and proposed algorithms for investigation complete the review.},

To achieve degradation, lysosomes must fuse with closed autophagosomes. We previously reported that the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) protein syntaxin (STX) 17 translocates to autophagosomes to mediate fusion with lysosomes. In this study, we report an additional mechanism. We found that autophagosome-lysosome fusion is retained to some extent even in STX17 knockout (KO) HeLa cells. By screening other human SNAREs, we identified YKT6 as a novel autophagosomal SNARE protein. Depletion of YKT6 inhibited autophagosome-lysosome fusion partially in wild-type and completely in STX17 KO cells, suggesting that YKT6 and STX17 are independently required for fusion. YKT6 formed a SNARE complex with SNAP29 and lysosomal STX7, both of which are required for autophagosomal fusion. Recruitment of YKT6 to autophagosomes depends on its N-terminal longin domain but not on the C-terminal palmitoylation and farnesylation that are essential for its Golgi localization. These findings suggest that two independent SNARE complexes mediate autophagosome-lysosome fusion.},

Defects in the assembly of a collagen matrix lead to pathologies including fibrosis and osteogenesis imperfecta. Owing to the size of fibril-forming procollagen molecules it is assumed that they are transported from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi in specialized large COPII-dependent carriers. Here, analyzing endogenous procollagen and a new engineered GFP-tagged form, we show that transport to the Golgi occurs in the absence of large ({$>$}350 nm) carriers. Large GFP-positive structures were observed occasionally, but these were nondynamic, are not COPII positive, and are labeled with markers of the ER. We propose a short-loop model of COPII-dependent ER-to-Golgi traffic that, while consistent with models of ERGIC-dependent expansion of COPII carriers, does not invoke long-range trafficking of large vesicular structures. Our findings provide an important insight into the process of procollagen trafficking and reveal a short-loop pathway from the ER to the Golgi, without the use of large carriers.},

  abstract = {Background 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) is the most common microdeletion disorder, affecting an estimated 1 : 2000\textendash 4000 live births. Patients with 22q11.2DS have a broad spectrum of phenotypic abnormalities which generally includes congenital cardiac abnormalities, palatal anomalies, and immunodeficiency. Additional findings, such as skeletal anomalies and autoimmune disorders, can confer significant morbidity in a subset of patients. 22q11.2DS is a contiguous gene DS and over 40 genes are deleted in patients; thus deletion of several genes within this region contributes to the clinical features. Mutations outside or on the remaining 22q11.2 allele are also known to modify the phenotype. Methods We utilised whole exome, targeted exome and/or Sanger sequencing to examine the genome of 17 patients with 22q11.2 deletions and phenotypic features found in {$<$}10\% of affected individuals. Results and conclusions In four unrelated patients, we identified three novel mutations in SNAP29, the gene implicated in the autosomal recessive condition cerebral dysgenesis, neuropathy, ichthyosis and keratoderma (CEDNIK). SNAP29 maps to 22q11.2 and encodes a soluble SNARE protein that is predicted to mediate vesicle fusion at the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi membranes. This work confirms that the phenotypic variability observed in a subset of patients with 22q11.2DS is due to mutations on the non-deleted chromosome, which leads to unmasking of autosomal recessive conditions such as CEDNIK, Kousseff, and a potentially autosomal recessive form of Opitz G/BBB syndrome. Furthermore, our work implicates SNAP29 as a major modifier of variable expressivity in 22q11.2 DS patients.},

  abstract = {The vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) is an ATP-driven proton pump involved in many cellular processes. An important mechanism by which V-ATPase activity is controlled is the reversible assembly of its two domains, namely the peripheral V1 domain and the integral V0 domain. Although reversible assembly is conserved across all eukaryotic organisms, the signaling pathways controlling it have not been fully characterized. Here, we identify glucose starvation as a novel regulator of V-ATPase assembly in mammalian cells. During acute glucose starvation, the V-ATPase undergoes a rapid and reversible increase in assembly and activity as measured by lysosomal acidification. Because the V-ATPase has recently been implicated in the activation of AMP kinase (AMPK), a critical cellular energy sensor that is also activated upon glucose starvation, we compared the time course of AMPK activation and V-ATPase assembly upon glucose starvation. We observe that AMPK activation precedes increased V-ATPase activity. Moreover, the starvation-induced increase in V-ATPase activity and assembly are prevented by the AMPK inhibitor dorsomorphin. These results suggest that increased assembly and activity of the V-ATPase upon glucose starvation are dependent upon AMPK. We also find that the PI3K/Akt pathway, which has previously been implicated in controlling V-ATPase assembly in mammalian cells, also plays a role in the starvation-induced increase in V-ATPase assembly and activity. These studies thus identify a novel stimulus of V-ATPase assembly and a novel signaling pathway involved in regulating this process. The possible function of starvation-induced increase in lysosomal V-ATPase activity is discussed.},

This architecture suggests the ability to both tether organelles and transport lipids between them. We show that in oxysterol binding protein (OSBP) these two activities are coupled by a four-step cycle. Membrane tethering by~the PH domain and the FFAT motif enables sterol transfer by the lipid transfer domain (ORD), followed by back transfer of PI(4)P by the ORD. Finally, PI(4)P is hydrolyzed in cis by the ER protein Sac1. The energy provided by PI(4)P hydrolysis drives sterol transfer and allows negative feedback when PI(4)P becomes limiting. Other lipid transfer proteins are tethered by the same mechanism. Thus, OSBP-mediated back transfer of PI(4)P might coordinate the transfer of other lipid species at the ER-Golgi interface.},

  abstract = {Arginine-based endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localization signals are sorting motifs that are involved in the biosynthetic transport of multimeric membrane proteins. After their discovery in the invariant chain of the major histocompatibility complex class II, several hallmarks of these signals have emerged. They occur in polytopic membrane proteins that are subunits of membrane protein complexes; the presence of the signal maintains improperly assembled subunits in the ER by retention or retrieval until it is masked as a result of heteromultimeric assembly. A distinct consensus sequence and their position independence with respect to the distal termini of the protein distinguish them from other ER-sorting motifs. Recognition by the coatomer (COPI) vesicle coat explains ER retrieval. Often, di-leucine endocytic signals occur close to arginine-based signals. Recruitment of 14-3-3 family or PDZ-domain proteins can counteract ER-localization activity, as can phosphorylation. This, and the occurrence of arginine-based signals in alternatively spliced regions, implicates them in the regulated surface expression of multimeric membrane proteins in addition to their function in quality control.},

Here we describe sensors for secretion and neurotransmission that fulfil these criteria. We have developed pH-sensitive mutants of green fluorescent protein ('pHluorins') by structure-directed combinatorial mutagenesis, with the aim of exploiting the acidic pH inside secretory vesicles to monitor vesicle exocytosis and recycling. When linked to a vesicle membrane protein, pHluorins were sorted to secretory and synaptic vesicles and reported transmission at individual synaptic boutons, as well as secretion and fusion pore 'flicker' of single secretory granules.},

Here, we use an unbiased genome-wide genetic screen in near-haploid human cells to uncover cellular processes that regulate HIF1{$\alpha$}.

Rather than preventing the lysosomal degradation of HIF1{$\alpha$}, disrupting the V-ATPase results in intracellular iron depletion, thereby impairing PHD activity and leading to HIF activation. Iron supplementation directly restores PHD catalytic activity following V-ATPase inhibition, revealing important links between the V-ATPase, iron metabolism and HIFs.},

Based on this evidence, we have proposed that PC-I is transported across the Golgi stacks by the cisternal maturation process. However, most secretory cargoes are small, freely diffusing proteins, thus raising the issue whether they move by a transport mechanism different than that used by PC-I. To address this question we have developed procedures to compare the transport of a small protein, the G protein of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSVG), with that of the much larger PC-I aggregates in the same cell. Transport was followed using a combination of video and EM, providing high resolution in time and space. Our results reveal that PC-I aggregates and VSVG move synchronously through the Golgi at indistinguishable rapid rates. Additionally, not only PC-I aggregates (as confirmed by ultrarapid cryofixation), but also VSVG, can traverse the stack without leaving the cisternal lumen and without entering Golgi vesicles in functionally relevant amounts. Our findings indicate that a common mechanism independent of anterograde dissociative carriers is responsible for the traffic of small and large secretory cargo across the Golgi stack.},

  abstract = {The SNARE protein syntaxin 5 exists as long (42 kDa) and short (35 kDa) isoforms. The short form is principally localized in the Golgi complex, whereas the long form resides not only in the Golgi but also in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Although the Golgi-localized short form has been extensively investigated, little is known about the long form. In the present study, we demonstrate that the long form of syntaxin 5 functions to shape the ER. We found that overexpression of the long form of syntaxin 5 induces rearrangement and co-alignment of the ER membrane with microtubules, the pattern of which is quite similar to that observed in cells overexpressing CLIMP-63, a linker between the ER membrane and microtubules. The ability of syntaxin 5 to induce ER-microtubule rearrangement is not related to its SNARE function, but correlates with its binding affinities for CLIMP-63, and CLIMP-63 is essential for the induction of this rearrangement. Microtubule co-sedimentation assays demonstrated that the long form of syntaxin 5 has a substantial microtubule-binding activity. These results suggest that the long form of syntaxin 5 contributes to the regulation of ER structure by interacting with both CLIMP-63 and microtubules. Indeed, depletion of syntaxin 5 caused the spreading of the ER to the cell periphery, similar to the phenotype observed in cells treated with the microtubule-depolymerizing reagent nocodazole. Our results disclose a previously undescribed function of the long form of syntaxin 5 that is not related to its function as a SNARE.},

A rapidly growing body of evidence indicates that these GTPases do not act as lone agents but are networked to one another through a variety of mechanisms to coordinate the individual events of one stage of transport and to link together the different stages of an entire transport pathway. These mechanisms include guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) cascades, GTPase-activating protein (GAP) cascades, effectors that bind to multiple GTPases, and positive-feedback loops generated by exchange factor-effector interactions. Together these mechanisms can lead to an ordered series of transitions from one GTPase to the next. As each GTPase recruits a unique set of effectors, these transitions help to define changes in the functionality of the membrane compartments with which they are associated.},

A combined disorder in the biosynthesis of N- and O-linked glycosylation with hyposialylation was detected. Western blot analysis showed a severe reduction in the COG5 and 7 subunits of the COG. A homozygous, intronic splice site mutation (c.169+4A{$>$}C) of the COG7 gene was identified in all patients. The phenotype is similar to that previously described in two patients of North African ethnicity with the same mutation, except for the lack of skeletal anomalies and only a mild liver involvement in our patients. We suggest performing protein glycosylation studies and Western blot for the different COG subunits in patients with progressive microcephaly, growth retardation, hypotonia, adducted thumbs and cardiac defects, especially in association with skin anomalies or episodes of hyperthermia.

The most common forms are inherited in an autosomal recessive or dominant fashion. Fibulin 5 and elastin mutations were detected in a limited number of patients, but in most cases the etiology is not known. Based on a previous observation of an abnormal transferrin isoelectric focusing pattern in a patient with cutis laxa indicating an N-glycosylation defect, we performed a screening for disorders of protein glycosylation in unrelated children with cutis laxa syndrome, including a recently developed test for defective O-glycosylation. Here, we describe five patients from consanguineous marriages with a cutis laxa syndrome with skeletal and joint involvement, developmental delay and neurological findings. Three of these five children have an inborn error of glycan biosynthesis affecting the synthesis of both N- and O-linked glycans. Two patients had normal glycosylation patterns. All known causes of secondary glycosylation disorders were excluded in the children. No mutations were found in the FBLN5 gene. In conclusion, we have identified a new combined glycosylation defect with a distinct clinical phenotype. Our results suggest that a combined defect of glycosylation might be a causative factor in congenital cutis laxa. This is the first report where abnormal N- and O-linked glycosylation is implicated in the etiology of cutis laxa syndrome.},

Both toxins depend on host cell machinery for internalization, retrograde trafficking from endosomes to the ER, and translocation to cytosol. Although both toxins follow a similar intracellular route, it is unknown how much they rely on the same genes. Here we conducted two genome-wide RNAi screens identifying genes required for intoxication and demonstrating that requirements are strikingly different between PE and Ricin, with only 13\% overlap. Yet factors required by both toxins are present from the endosomes to the ER, and, at the morphological level, the toxins colocalize in multiple structures. Interestingly, Ricin, but not PE, depends on Golgi complex integrity and colocalizes significantly with a medial Golgi marker. Our data are consistent with two intertwined pathways converging and diverging at multiple points and reveal the complexity of retrograde membrane trafficking in mammalian cells.},

  abstract = {How autophagic degradation is linked to endosomal trafficking routes is little known. Here we screened a collection of uncharacterized Drosophila mutants affecting membrane transport to identify new genes that also have a role in autophagy. We isolated a loss of function mutant in Snap29 (Synaptosomal-associated protein 29~kDa), the gene encoding the Drosophila homolog of the human protein SNAP29 and have characterized its function in vivo. Snap29 contains 2 soluble NSF attachment protein receptor (SNARE) domains and a asparagine-proline-phenylalanine (NPF motif) at its N terminus and rescue experiments indicate that both SNARE domains are required for function, whereas the NPF motif is in part dispensable. We find that Snap29 interacts with SNARE proteins, localizes to multiple trafficking organelles, and is required for protein trafficking and for proper Golgi apparatus morphology. Developing tissue lacking Snap29 displays distinctive epithelial architecture defects and accumulates large amounts of autophagosomes, highlighting a major role of Snap29 in autophagy and secretion. Mutants for autophagy genes do not display epithelial architecture or secretion defects, suggesting that the these alterations of the Snap29 mutant are unlikely to be caused by the impairment of autophagy. In contrast, we find evidence of elevated levels of hop-Stat92E (hopscotch-signal transducer and activator of transcription protein at 92E) ligand, receptor, and associated signaling, which might underlie the epithelial defects. In summary, our findings support a role of Snap29 at key steps of membrane trafficking, and predict that signaling defects may contribute to the pathogenesis of cerebral dysgenesis, neuropathy, ichthyosis, and palmoplantar keratoderma (CEDNIK), a human congenital syndrome due to loss of Snap29.},

Here, we show that recognition of the ER-Golgi SNAREs Bet1, Sed5, and Sec22 occurs through three binding sites on the Sec23/24 subcomplex of yeast COPII. The A site binds to the YNNSNPF motif of Sed5. The B site binds to Lxx-L/M-E sequences present in both the Bet1 and Sed5 molecules, as well as to the DxE cargo-sorting signal. A third, spatially distinct site binds to Sec22. COPII selects the free v-SNARE form of Bet1 because the LxxLE sequence is sequestered in the four-helix bundle of the v-/t-SNARE complex. COPII favors Sed5 within the Sed5/Bos1/Sec22 t-SNARE complex because t-SNARE assembly removes autoinhibitory contacts to expose the YNNSNPF motif. The COPII coat seems to be a specific conductor of the fusogenic forms of these SNAREs, suggesting how vesicle fusion specificity may be programmed during budding.},

To provide further insight into the function of NSF, we have introduced a mutation into mammalian NSF that, in Drosophila dNSF-1, leads to temperature-sensitive neuroparalysis. This mutation is like the comatose mutation and renders the mammalian NSF temperature sensitive for fusion of postmitotic Golgi vesicles and tubules into intact cisternae. Unexpectedly, at the temperature that is permissive for membrane fusion, this mutant NSF binds to, but cannot disassemble, SNARE complexes and exhibits almost no ATPase activity. A well-charaterized NSF mutant containing an inactivating point mutation in the catalytic site of its ATPase domain is equally active in the Golgi-reassembly assay. These data indicate that the need for NSF during postmitotic Golgi membrane fusion may be distinct from its ATPase-dependent ability to break up SNARE pairs.},

  abstract = {Glycan structures covalently attached to proteins and lipids play numerous roles in mammalian cells, including protein folding, targeting, recognition, and adhesion at the molecular or cellular level. Regulating the abundance of glycan structures on cellular glycoproteins and glycolipids is a complex process that depends on numerous factors. Most models for glycan regulation hypothesize that transcriptional control of the enzymes involved in glycan synthesis, modification, and catabolism determines glycan abundance and diversity. However, few broad-based studies have examined correlations between glycan structures and transcripts encoding the relevant biosynthetic and catabolic enzymes. Low transcript abundance for many glycan-related genes has hampered broad-based transcript profiling for comparison with glycan structural data. In an effort to facilitate comparison with glycan structural data and to identify the molecular basis of alterations in glycan structures, we have developed a medium-throughput quantitative real time reverse transcriptase-PCR platform for the analysis of transcripts encoding glycan-related enzymes and proteins in mouse tissues and cells. The method employs a comprehensive list of {$>$}700 genes, including enzymes involved in sugar-nucleotide biosynthesis, transporters, glycan extension, modification, recognition, catabolism, and numerous glycosylated core proteins. Comparison with parallel microarray analyses indicates a significantly greater sensitivity and dynamic range for our quantitative real time reverse transcriptase-PCR approach, particularly for the numerous low abundance glycan-related enzymes. Mapping of the genes and transcript levels to their respective biosynthetic pathway steps allowed a comparison with glycan structural data and provides support for a model where many, but not all, changes in glycan abundance result from alterations in transcript expression of corresponding biosynthetic enzymes.},

Because of the challenges associated with studying glycan regulation in vertebrate embryos, we have chosen to study mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells as they differentiate into embryoid bodies (EBs) or into extraembryonic endodermal (ExE) cells as a model for cellular differentiation. We profiled N- and O-glycan structures isolated from these cell populations and examined transcripts encoding the corresponding enzymatic machinery for glycan biosynthesis in an effort to probe the mechanisms that drive the regulation of glycan diversity. During differentiation from mouse ES cells to either EBs or ExE cells, general trends were detected. The predominance of high mannose N-glycans in ES cells shifted to an equal abundance of complex and high mannose structures, increased sialylation, and increased {$\alpha$}-Gal termination in the differentiated cell populations. Whereas core 1 O-glycan structures predominated in all three cell populations, increased sialylation and increased core diversity characterized the O-glycans of both differentiated cell types. Increased polysialylation was also found in both differentiated cell types. Differences between the two differentiated cell types included greater sialylation of N-glycans in EBs, whereas {$\alpha$}-Gal-capped structures were more prevalent in ExE cells. Changes in glycan structures generally, but not uniformly, correlated with alterations in transcript abundance for the corresponding biosynthetic enzymes, suggesting that transcriptional regulation contributes significantly to the regulation of glycan expression. Knowledge of glycan structural diversity and transcript regulation should provide greater understanding of the roles of protein glycosylation in vertebrate development.},

The majority of PM cholesterol forms complexes with other PM lipids, making it inaccessible for intracellular transport. Transition of PM cholesterol between accessible and inaccessible pools maintains cellular homeostasis, but how cells monitor the accessibility of PM cholesterol remains unclear. We show that endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-anchored lipid transfer proteins, the GRAMD1s, sense and transport accessible PM cholesterol to the ER. GRAMD1s bind to one another and populate ER-PM contacts by sensing a transient expansion of the accessible pool of PM cholesterol via their GRAM domains. They then facilitate the transport of this cholesterol via their StART-like domains. Cells that lack all three GRAMD1s exhibit striking expansion of the accessible pool of PM cholesterol as a result of less efficient PM to ER transport of accessible cholesterol. Thus, GRAMD1s facilitate the movement of accessible PM cholesterol to the ER in order to counteract an acute increase of PM cholesterol, thereby activating non-vesicular cholesterol transport.},

The assembly of Sar1 is suppressed by protein kinase inhibitor H89, suggesting that ER-to-Golgi transport is regulated progressively by H89 sensitive kinase. ER-resident Gi2 protein suppresses vesicle formation with inhibition of Sar1 assembly. This study examined whether these promotion and suppression of vesicle transport share the same signal pathway, by examining the effects of Gi/o protein activator mastoparan 7 (Mp-7) and H89 on Sar1 and Sec23 recruitment onto microsomes. In a cell-free system for Sar1 translocation assay, GTP{$\gamma$}S addition induced the translocation of Sar1 onto microsomes. Mp-7 and H89 decreased the Sar1 translocation. Double treatment of Mp-7 and H89 strongly decreased Sar1 translocation. In single and double treatments, however, Gi/o protein inactivator pertussis toxin (IAP) partially restored the suppressive effect of Mp-7, but had not any effect on H89-induced effect. Then, the assembly of Sec23 onto the microsome was also increased by the addition of GTP{$\gamma$}S. Sec23 translocation was decreased by Mp-7 and/or H89 treatment and recovered by IAP pretreatment except for H89 single treatment, similarly to Sar1 translocation in each treatment. Inhibitory effects of H89 and Mp-7on ER-to-Golgi vesicle transport by H89 or Mp-7 were also confirmed in a cell culture system by BFA-dispersion and BFA-reconstruction experiments. These findings indicate that promotion and suppression of ER-to-Golgi vesicle transport are modulated through separate signal pathways.},

A screen for genes involved in endosome-to-TGN trafficking produced two hits, the adaptor protein-1 (AP-1 complex), which facilitates vesicle budding, and WDR11. Here we demonstrate that WDR11 forms a stable complex with two other proteins, which localises to the TGN region and does not appear to be associated with AP-1, suggesting it may act downstream from budding. In a vesicle tethering assay, capture of vesicles by golgin-245 was substantially reduced in WDR11-knockout cells. Moreover, structured illumination microscopy and relocation assays indicate that the WDR11 complex is initially recruited onto vesicles rather than the TGN, where it may in turn recruit the golgin binding partner TBC1D23. We propose that the complex acts together with TBC1D23 to facilitate the golgin-mediated capture of vesicles that were generated using AP-1.},

To inquire into the site and mechanism of TAP/p115 action, we aimed to localize it and to identify domains required for its function. We show that in interphase cells, TAP/p115 localizes predominantly to the Golgi and to peripheral structures that represent vesicular tubular clusters (VTCs) involved in ER to Golgi transport. Using BFA/ nocodazole treatments we confirm that TAP/p115 is present on ER to Golgi transport intermediates. TAP/ p115 redistributes to peripheral structures containing ERGIC-53 during a 15\textdegree C treatment, suggesting that it is a cycling protein. Within the Golgi, TAP/p115 is associated with pleiomorphic structures on the cis side of the cis-Golgi cisterna and the cis-most cisterna, but is not detected in more distal compartments of the Golgi.TAP/p115 binds the cis-Golgi protein GM130, and the COOH-terminal acidic domain of TAP/p115 is required for this interaction. TAP/p115 interaction with GM130 occurs only in the Golgi and is not required for TAP/p115 association with peripheral VTCs. To examine whether interaction with GM130 is required to recruit TAP/p115 to the Golgi, TAP/p115 mutants lacking the acidic domain were expressed and localized in transfected cells. Mutants lacking the GM130-binding domain showed normal Golgi localization, indicating that TAP/p115 is recruited to the Golgi independently of its ability to bind GM130. Such mutants were also able to associate with peripheral VTCs. Interestingly, TAP/p115 mutants containing the GM130-binding domain but lacking portions of the NH2-terminal region were restricted from the Golgi and localized to the ER. The COOH-terminal domain required for GM130 binding and the NH2-terminal region required for Golgi localization appear functionally relevant since expression of TAP/p115 mutants lacking either of these domains leads to loss of normal Golgi morphology.},

While screening a yeast genomic library for genes complementing the ER-accumulating mutant bet1 (A. Newman and S. Ferro-Novick, J. Cell Biol. 105: 1587-1594, 1987), we isolated BET1 and BOS1 (bet one suppressor). BOS1 suppresses bet1-1 in a gene dosage-dependent manner, providing greater suppression when it is introduced on a multicopy vector than when one additional copy is present. The BET1 and BOS1 genes are not functionally equivalent; overproduction of BOS1 does not alleviate the lethality associated with disruption of BET1. We also identified a pattern of genetic interactions among these genes and another gene implicated in transport from the ER to the Golgi complex: SEC22. Overproduction of either BET1 or BOS1 suppresses the growth and secretory defects of the sec22-3 mutant over a wide range of temperatures. Further evidence for genetic interaction was provided by the finding that a bet1 sec22 double mutant is inviable. Another mutant which is blocked in transport from the ER to the Golgi complex, sec21-1, demonstrates a more limited ability to be suppressed by the BET1 gene. The interactions we observed are specific for genes required for transport from the ER to the Golgi complex. The products of the genes involved are likely to have a direct role in transport, as bet1-1 and sec22-3 begin to display their mutant phenotypes within 5 min of a shift to the restrictive temperature.},

  abstract = {Soluble factors, NSF and SNAPs, are required at many membrane fusion events within the cell. They interact with a class of type II integral membrane proteins termed SNAP receptors, or SNAREs. Interaction between cognate SNAREs on opposing membranes is a prerequisite for NSF dependent membrane fusion. NSF is an ATPase which will disrupt complexes composed of different SNAREs. However, there is increasingly abundant evidence that the SNARE complex recognised by NSF does not bridge the two fusing membranes, but rather is composed of SNAREs in the same membrane. The essential role of NSF may be to prime SNAREs for a direct role during fusion. The best characterised SNAREs in the Golgi are Sed5p in yeast and its mammalian homologue syntaxin 5, both of which are predominantly localised to the cis Golgi. The SNARE-SNARE interactions in which these two proteins are involved are strikingly similar. Sed5p and syntaxin 5 may mediate three distinct pathways for membrane flow into the cis Golgi, one from the ER, one from later Golgi cisternae, and possibly a third from endosomes. Syntaxin 5 is itself likely to cycle through the ER, and thus may be involved in homotypic fusion of ER derived transport vesicles. In all well characterised SNARE dependent membrane fusion events one of the interacting SNAREs is a syntaxin homologue. There are only eight members of the syntaxin family in yeast. Besides Sed5p two others, Tlg1p and Tlg2p, are found in the Golgi complex. They are present in a late Golgi compartment, but neither is required for transit of secreted proteins through the Golgi. We suggest that these observations are most compatible with a model for transit through the Golgi in which anterograde cargo is carried in cisternae, the enzymatic composition of which changes with time as Golgi resident enzymes are delivered in retrograde transport vesicles.},

To date, mutations in three genes (FZD4, LRP5, and NDP) have been shown to be causative for FEVR. In two large Dutch pedigrees segregating autosomal-dominant FEVR, genome-wide SNP analysis identified an FEVR locus of {$\sim$}40 Mb on chromosome 7. Microsatellite marker analysis suggested similar at risk haplotypes in patients of both families. To identify the causative gene, we applied next-generation sequencing in the proband of one of the families, by analyzing all exons and intron-exon boundaries of 338 genes, in addition to microRNAs, noncoding RNAs, and other highly conserved genomic regions in the 40 Mb linkage interval. After detailed bioinformatic analysis of the sequence data, prioritization of all detected sequence variants led to three candidates to be considered as the causative genetic defect in this family. One of these variants was an alanine-to-proline substitution in the transmembrane 4 superfamily member 12 protein, encoded by TSPAN12. This protein has very recently been implicated in regulating the development of retinal vasculature, together with the proteins encoded by FZD4, LRP5, and NDP. Sequence analysis of TSPAN12 revealed two mutations segregating in five of 11 FEVR families, indicating that mutations in~TSPAN12 are a relatively frequent cause of FEVR. Furthermore, we demonstrate the power of targeted next-generation sequencing technology to identify disease genes in linkage intervals.},

  abstract = {We have identified cDNAs encoding three isoforms (a1, a2, and a3) of the 100-kDa a subunit of the mouse vacuolar proton-translocating ATPase (V-ATPase). The predicted protein sequences of the three isoforms are 838, 856, and 834 amino acids, respectively, and they display approximately 50\% identity between isoforms. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that all three isoforms are expressed in most tissues examined. However, the a1 isoform is expressed most heavily in brain and heart, a2 in liver and kidney, and a3 in liver, lung, heart, brain, spleen, and kidney. We also identified multiple alternatively spliced variants for each isoform. Reverse transcriptase-mediated polymerase chain reaction revealed that one splicing variant of the a1 isoform (a1-I) was expressed only in brain, whereas two other variants (a1-II and a1-III) were expressed in tissues other than brain. These alternatively spliced forms differ in the presence or absence of 6-7 amino acid residues near the amino and carboxyl termini of the proteins encoded. The a3 isoform is also encoded by three alternatively spliced variants, two of which are predicted to encode a protein that is truncated near the border of the amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains of the a subunit and therefore lacks the integral transmembrane-spanning helices thought to participate in proton translocation. Expression of each isoform (with the exception of a1-I) was detectable at all developmental stages investigated, with a1-I absent only in day 7 embryos. The results obtained suggest that isoforms of the 100-kDa a subunit may contribute to tissue-specific functions of the V-ATPase.},

Knockdown of SLY1 by siRNA arrested Procollagen VII in the ER without affecting the recruitment of COPII components, general protein secretion, and retrograde transport of the KDEL-containing protein BIP, and ERGIC53. SLY1 is known to interact with the ER-specific SNARE proteins Syntaxin 17 and 18, however only Syntaxin 18 was required for Procollagen VII export. Neither SLY1 nor Syntaxin 18 was required for the export of the equally bulky Procollagen I from the ER. Altogether, these findings reveal the sorting of bulky collagen family members by TANGO1 at the ER and highlight the existence of different export pathways for secretory cargoes one of which is mediated by the specific SNARE complex containing SLY1 and Syntaxin 18.},

  abstract = {Intracellular transport of recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) is still incompletely understood. In particular, the trafficking steps preceding the release of incoming AAV particles from the endosomal system into the cytoplasm, allowing subsequent nuclear import and the initiation of gene expression, remain to be elucidated fully. Others and we previously showed that a significant proportion of viral particles are transported to the Golgi apparatus and that Golgi apparatus disruption caused by the drug brefeldin A efficiently blocks AAV serotype 2 (AAV2) transduction. However, because brefeldin A is known to exert pleiotropic effects on the entire endosomal system, the functional relevance of transport to the Golgi apparatus for AAV transduction remains to be established definitively. Here, we show that AAV2 trafficking toward the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and the Golgi apparatus correlates with transduction efficiency and relies on a nonclassical retrograde transport pathway that is independent of the retromer complex, late endosomes, and recycling endosomes. AAV2 transduction is unaffected by the knockdown of syntaxins 6 and 16, which are two major effectors in the retrograde transport of both exogenous and endogenous cargo. On the other hand, inhibition of syntaxin 5 function by small interfering RNA silencing or treatment with cyclized Retro-2 strongly decreases AAV2 transduction and transport to the Golgi apparatus. This inhibition of transduction is observed with several AAV serotypes and a number of primary and immortalized cells. Together, our data strongly suggest that syntaxin 5-mediated retrograde transport to the Golgi apparatus is a broadly conserved feature of AAV trafficking that appears to be independent of the identity of the receptors used for viral attachment. IMPORTANCE Gene therapy constitutes a promising approach for the treatment of life-threatening conditions refractory to any other form of remedy. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors are currently being evaluated for the treatment of diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, heart failure, Parkinson's disease, and others. Despite their promise as gene delivery vehicles, a better understanding of the biology of AAV-based vectors is necessary to improve further their efficacy. AAV vectors must reach the nucleus in order to deliver their genome, and their intracellular transport is not fully understood. Here, we dissect an important step of the intracellular journey of AAV by showing that retrograde transport of capsids to the trans-Golgi network is necessary for gene delivery. We show that the AAV trafficking route differs from that of known Golgi apparatus-targeted cargos, and we raise the possibility that this nonclassical pathway is shared by most AAV variants, regardless of their attachment receptors.},

  abstract = {Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is characterized by insulin resistance and {$\beta$}-cell failure. Insulin resistance per se, however, does not provoke overt diabetes as long as compensatory {$\beta$}-cell function is maintained. The increased demand for insulin stresses the {$\beta$}-cell endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and secretory pathway, and ER stress is associated with {$\beta$}-cell failure in T2D. The tail recognition complex (TRC) pathway, including Asna1/TRC40, is implicated in the maintenance of endomembrane trafficking and ER homeostasis. To gain insight into the role of Asna1/TRC40 in maintaining endomembrane homeostasis and {$\beta$}-cell function, we inactivated Asna1 in {$\beta$}-cells of mice. We show that Asna1{$\beta-$}/- mice develop hypoinsulinemia, impaired insulin secretion, and glucose intolerance that rapidly progresses to overt diabetes. Loss of Asna1 function leads to perturbed plasma membrane-to-trans Golgi network and Golgi-to-ER retrograde transport as well as to ER stress in {$\beta$}-cells. Of note, pharmacological inhibition of retrograde transport in isolated islets and insulinoma cells mimicked the phenotype of Asna1{$\beta-$}/- {$\beta$}-cells and resulted in reduced insulin content and ER stress. These data support a model where Asna1 ensures retrograde transport and, hence, ER and insulin homeostasis in {$\beta$}-cells.},

While a role for the ER during phagosome biogenesis has been recognized, whether fusion with ER cisternae or vesicular derivatives occurs has been the source of much contention. Membrane contact sites (MCS) are tight appositions between ER membranes and various organelles that coordinate multiple functions including localized signalling, lipid transfer and trafficking. The discovery that MCS form between the ER and phagosomes now begs the question of whether MCS play a role in connecting the ER to phagosomes under different contexts. In this review, we consider the implications of MCS between the ER and phagosomes during cross-presentation and infection with intracellular pathogens. We also discuss the similarities between these contacts and those between the ER and plasma membrane and acidic organelles such as endosomes and lysosomes.

  abstract = {The conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex is a soluble hetero-octamer associated with the cytoplasmic surface of the Golgi. Mammalian somatic cell mutants lacking the Cog1 (ldlB) or Cog2 (ldlC) subunits exhibit pleiotropic defects in Golgi-associated glycoprotein and glycolipid processing that suggest COG is involved in the localization, transport, and/or function of multiple Golgi processing proteins. We have identified a set of COG-sensitive, integral membrane Golgi proteins called GEARs (mannosidase II, GOS-28, GS15, GPP130, CASP, giantin, and golgin-84) whose abundances were reduced in the mutant cells and, in some cases, increased in COG-overexpressing cells. In the mutants, some GEARs were abnormally localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and were degraded by proteasomes. The distributions of the GEARs were altered by small interfering RNA depletion of {$\epsilon$}-COP in wild-type cells under conditions in which COG-insensitive proteins were unaffected. Furthermore, synthetic phenotypes arose in mutants deficient in both {$\epsilon$}-COP and either Cog1 or Cog2. COG and COPI may work in concert to ensure the proper retention or retrieval of a subset of proteins in the Golgi, and COG helps prevent the endoplasmic reticulum accumulation and degradation of some GEARs.},

  abstract = {The conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex is an eight-subunit (Cog1\textendash 8) peripheral Golgi protein involved in Golgi-associated membrane trafficking and glycoconjugate synthesis. We have analyzed the structure and function of COG using Cog1 or Cog2 null Chinese hamster ovary cell mutants, fibroblasts from a patient with Cog7-deficient congenital disorders of glycosylation, and stable Cog5-deficient HeLa cells generated by RNA interference. Although the dilation of some Golgi cisternae in Cog5-deficient cells resembled that observed in Cog1- or Cog2-deficient cells, their global glycosylation defects (less severe) and intracellular processing and function of low density lipoprotein receptors (essentially normal) differed from Cog1- and Cog2-deficient cells. Immunoblotting, gel filtration, and immunofluorescence microscopy analyses of the COG-deficient cells and cell extracts indicated that 1) Cog2\textendash 4 and Cog5\textendash 7 form stable subcomplexes, 2) Cog1 mediates Golgi association of a Cog2\textendash 4 plus Cog8 subcomplex, 3) Cog8 associates stably with both Cog5\textendash 7 and Cog1\textendash 4 subcomplexes, and thus 4) Cog8 helps assemble the Cog1\textendash 4 and Cog5\textendash 7 subcomplexes into the complete COG complex. This model of the subunit organization of COG is in excellent agreement with in vitro data presented in an accompanying paper (Ungar, D., Oka, T., Vasile, E., Krieger, M., and Hughson, F. M. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 32729\textendash 32735). Only one or two of the seven Cog1- or Cog2-dependent Golgi membrane proteins called GEARs are also sensitive to Cog5 or Cog7 deficiency, indicating that the COG subunits play distinctive roles in controlling Golgi structure and function.},

The capacity of the ER is enhanced by the mechanism called the ER stress response, but the mechanism regulating Golgi capacity (the Golgi stress response) has remained unclear. Here, we found that transcription of Golgi-related genes, including glycosylation enzymes as well as factors involved in post-Golgi vesicular transport and maintenance of Golgi structure, was upregulated upon treatment with monensin, an ionophore that disrupts the function of acidic organelles, including the Golgi apparatus and lysosomes by neutralizing their lumen. This transcriptional induction was found to be commonly regulated by a novel cis-acting element called the Golgi apparatus stress response element (GASE), whose consensus sequence is ACGTGgc. When the function of the Golgi apparatus was specifically disturbed by overexpression of GCP60, a Golgi-localized protein that binds to giantin, transcription from GASE was significantly induced. These results suggest that mammalian cells have the Golgi stress response, and that GASE regulates transcriptional induction involved in the Golgi stress response.},

Biochemical and cell biological analysis suggested that TMEM115 has four candidate transmembrane domains located in the N-terminal region. Both the N- and C-terminal domains are oriented towards the cytoplasm. Immunofluorescence analysis supports that TMEM115 is enriched in the Golgi cisternae. Functionally, TMEM115 knockdown or overexpression delays Brefeldin-A-induced Golgi-to-ER retrograde transport, phenocopying cells with mutations or silencing of the conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex. Co-immunoprecipitation and in vitro binding experiments reveals that TMEM115 interacts with the COG complex, and might self-interact to form dimers or oligomers. A short region (residues 206\textendash 229) immediately to the C-terminal side of the fourth transmembrane domain is both necessary and sufficient for Golgi targeting. Knockdown of TMEM115 also reduces the binding of the lectins peanut agglutinin (PNA) and Helix pomatia agglutinin (HPA), suggesting an altered O-linked glycosylation profile. These results establish that TMEM115 is an integral membrane protein of the Golgi stack regulating Golgi-to-ER retrograde transport and is likely to be part of the machinery of the COG complex.},

The medial Golgi enzymes,N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I and II (GnTI and GnTII) required high salt for solubilization and migrated as high molecular weight complexes on sucrose density gradients. In contrast, the late acting Golgi enzymes, {$\beta$}1,4-galactosyltransferase and {$\alpha$}1,2-fucosyltransferase, were readily solubilized in low salt and migrated as monomers/dimers by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Analysis of membrane-bound GnTI chimeras indicates that the formation of high molecular weight complexes does not require the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail sequences of GnTI. Furthermore, a soluble form of GnTI, containing the stem region and catalytic domain, accumulated in the Golgi prior to secretion, in contrast to {$\beta$}1,4-galactosyltransferase. Soluble GnTI, which also associated with high molecular weight complexes, was comparable with membrane-bound GnTI in its ability to glycosylate newly synthesized glycoproteinsin vivo. Mutation of charged residues within the stem region of GnTI, known to be important for ``kin recognition'', had no effect on the efficiency of Golgi localization, the inclusion into high molecular weight complexes, nor functional activity in vivo. The differences in behavior between the medialand late acting Golgi enzymes may contribute to their differential localization and their ability to glycosylate efficiently in the correct Golgi subcompartment.},

  abstract = {Organelle acidification is an essential element of the endosomal-lysosomal pathway, but our understanding of the mechanisms underlying progression through this pathway has been hindered by the absence of adequate methods for quantifying intraorganelle pH. To address this problem in neurons, we developed a direct quantitative method for accurately determining the pH of endocytic organelles in live cells. In this report, we demonstrate that the ratiometric fluorescent pH indicator 8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid (HPTS) is the most advantageous available probe for such pH measurements. To measure intraorganelle pH, cells were labeled by endocytic uptake of HPTS, the ratio of fluorescence emission intensities at excitation wavelengths of 450 nm and 405 nm (F450/405) was calculated for each organelle, and ratios were converted to pH values by using standard curves for F450/405 vs. pH. Proper calibration is critical for accurate measurement of pH values: standard curves generated in vitro yielded artifactually low organelle pH values. Calibration was unaffected by the use of culture medium buffered with various buffers or different cell types. By using this technique, we show that both acidic and neutral endocytically derived organelles exist in the axons of sympathetic neurons in different steady-state proportions than in the cell body. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these axonal organelles have a bimodal pH distribution, indicating a rapid acidification step in their maturation that reduces the average pH of a fraction of the organelles by 2 pH units while leaving few organelles of intermediate pH at steady state. Finally, we demonstrate a spatial gradient or organelle pH along axons, with the relative frequency of acidic organelles increasing with proximity to the cell body.},

  abstract = {Neutrophils kill ingested pathogens by the so-called oxidative burst, where reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced in the lumen of phagosomes at very high rates (mM/sec), although these rates can only be maintained for a short period (minutes). In contrast, dendritic cells produce ROS at much lower rates, but they can sustain production for much longer after pathogen uptake (hours). It is becoming increasingly clear that this slow but prolonged ROS production is essential for antigen cross-presentation to activate cytolytic T cells and shapes the repertoire of antigen fragments for presentation to helper T cells. However, despite this importance of ROS production by dendritic cells for activation of the adaptive immune system, their actual ROS production rates have never been quantified. Here, we quantified ROS production in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells by measuring the oxygen consumption rate during phagocytosis. Although a large variation in oxygen consumption and phagocytic capacity was present among individuals and cells, we estimate a ROS production rate of on average \textasciitilde 0.5 mM/second per phagosome. Quantitative microscopy approaches showed that ROS is produced within minutes after pathogen encounter at the nascent phagocytic cup. H2DCFDA measurements revealed that ROS production is sustained for at least \textasciitilde 10 hours after uptake. While ROS are produced by dendritic cells at an about 10-fold lower rate than by neutrophils, the net total ROS production is approximately similar. These are the first quantitative estimates of ROS production by a cell capable of antigen cross-presentation. Our findings provide a quantitative insight in how ROS affect dendritic cell function.},

Deficient biosynthesis of COG subunits leads to alterations of protein trafficking along the secretory pathway and thereby to severe diseases in humans. Since the COG complex affects the localization of several Golgi glycosyltransferase enzymes, COG deficiency also leads to defective protein glycosylation, thereby explaining the classification of COG deficiencies as forms of congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG). To date, mutations in COG1, COG4, COG7 and COG8 genes have been associated with diseases, which range from severe multi-organ disorders to moderate forms of neurological impairment. In the present study, we describe a new type of COG deficiency related to a splicing mutation in the COG5 gene. Sequence analysis in the patient identified a homozygous intronic substitution (c.1669-15T{$>$}C) leading to exon skipping and severely reduced expression of the COG5 protein. This defect was associated with a mild psychomotor retardation with delayed motor and language development. Analysis of different serum glycoproteins revealed a CDG phenotype with typical undersialylation of N- and O-glycans. Retrograde Golgi-to-endoplasmic reticulum trafficking was markedly delayed in the patient's fibroblast upon brefeldin-A treatment, which is a hallmark of COG deficiency. This trafficking delay could be restored to normal values by expressing a wild-type COG5 cDNA in the patient cells. This case demonstrates that COG deficiency and thereby CDG must be taken into consideration even in children presenting mild neurological impairments.},

Conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG)-CDG are genetic diseases due to defects of the COG complex subunits 1\textendash 8 causing N-glycan and O-glycan processing abnormalities. In COG-CDG, isoelectric focusing separation of undersialylated glycoforms of serum transferrin and apolipoprotein C-III (apoC-III) allows to detect N-glycosylation and O-glycosylation defects, respectively. COG5-CDG (COG5 subunit deficiency) is a multisystem disease with dysmorphic features, intellectual disability of variable degree, seizures, acquired microcephaly, sensory defects and autistic behavior. We applied matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-MS for a high-throughput screening of differential serum O-glycoform and N-glycoform in five patients with COG5-CDG. When compared with age-matched controls, COG5-CDG showed a significant increase of apoC-III0a (aglycosylated glycoform), whereas apoC-III1 (mono-sialylated glycoform) decreased significantly. Serum N-glycome of COG5-CDG patients was characterized by the relative abundance of undersialylated and undergalactosylated biantennary and triantennary glycans as well as slight increase of high-mannose structures and hybrid glycans. Using advanced and well-established MS-based approaches, the present findings reveal novel aspects on O-glycan and N-glycan profiling in COG5-CDG patients, thus providing an increase of current knowledge on glycosylation defects caused by impairment of COG subunits, in support of clinical diagnosis.

  abstract = {A long-standing concept is that the Golgi apparatus is composed of distinct compartments, but the molecular identities of those compartments have not been clearly described. The idea of a compartmentalized Golgi is challenged by the cisternal maturation model, which postulates that cisternae form de novo and then undergo progressive biochemical changes. Cisternal maturation could potentially be reconciled with Golgi compartmentation by defining compartments as discrete stages in the maturation pathway. These stages would be distinguished by the traffic pathways that are operating. A limitation of this approach is that multiple traffic pathways drive Golgi maturation, and their periods of operation can overlap, so a large number of stages would need to be defined. After attempting such an exercise based on the available data, we conclude that the concept of Golgi compartmentation has outlived its usefulness. Instead, we propose that the focus should be on the series of transitions experienced by a Golgi cisterna as different traffic pathways are switched on and off. These traffic pathways drive changes in resident protein composition. Transitions in traffic pathways are the fundamental, conserved determinants of Golgi organization. According to this view, the initial goal is to identify the relevant traffic pathways and place them on the kinetic map of Golgi maturation, and the ultimate goal is to elucidate the logic circuit that switches individual traffic pathways on and off as a cisterna matures.},

Moreover, the small GTPase CDC42 regulates bidirectional Golgi transport by targeting the dual functions of COPI in cargo sorting and carrier formation. CDC42 also directly imparts membrane curvature to promote COPI tubule formation. Our findings further reveal that COPI tubular transport complements cisternal maturation in explaining how anterograde Golgi transport is achieved, and that bidirectional COPI transport is modulated by environmental cues through CDC42.},

Via whole-exome sequencing, we studied a child that presented with cranial asymmetry, severe infantile spasms with hypsarrhythmia, and dysproportionate dwarfism. Analysis of transferrin glycosylation revealed severe dysglycosylation corresponding to a type II congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG) and the blood manganese levels were below the detection limit. The variants c.112G{$>$}C (p.Gly38Arg) and c.1019T{$>$}A (p.Ile340Asn) were identified in SLC39A8. A second individual with the variants c.97G{$>$}A (p.Val33Met) and c.1004G{$>$}C (p.Ser335Thr) on the paternal allele and c.610G{$>$}T (p.Gly204Cys) on the maternal allele was identified among a group of unresolved case subjects with CDG. These data demonstrate that variants in SLC39A8 impair the function of manganese-dependent enzymes, most notably {$\beta$}-1,4-galactosyltransferase, a Golgi enzyme essential for biosynthesis of the carbohydrate part of glycoproteins. Impaired galactosylation leads to a severe disorder with deformed skull, severe seizures, short limbs, profound psychomotor retardation, and hearing loss. Oral galactose supplementation is a treatment option and results in complete normalization of glycosylation. SLC39A8 deficiency links a trace element deficiency with inherited glycosylation disorders.},

  abstract = {Syntaxin-5 (Sed5) is the only syntaxin needed for transport into and across the yeast Golgi, raising the question of how a single syntaxin species could mediate vesicle transport in both the anterograde and the retrograde direction within the stack. Sed5 is known to combine with two light chains (Bos1 and Sec22) to form the t-SNARE needed to receive vesicles from the endoplasmic reticulum. However, the yeast Golgi contains several other potential light chains with which Sed5 could potentially combine to form other t-SNAREs. To explore the degree of specificity in the choice of light chains by a t-SNARE, we undertook a comprehensive examination of the capacity of all 21 Sed5-based t-SNAREs that theoretically could assemble in the yeast Golgi to fuse with each of the 7 potential v-SNAREs also present in this organelle. Only one additional of these 147 combinations was fusogenic. This functional proteomic strategy thereby revealed a previously uncharacterized t-SNARE in which Sed5 is the heavy chain and Gos1 and Ykt6 are the light chains, and whose unique cognate v-SNARE is Sft1. Immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed the existence of this complex in vivo. Fusion mediated by this second Golgi SNAREpin is topologically restricted, and existing genetic and morphologic evidence implies that it is used for transport across the Golgi stack. From this study, together with the previous functional proteomic analyses which have tested 275 distinct quaternary SNARE combinations, it follows that the fusion potential and transport pathways of the yeast cell can be read out from its genome sequence according to the SNARE hypothesis with a predictive accuracy of about 99.6\%.},

  abstract = {To fuse transport vesicles with target membranes, proteins of the SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors) complex must be located on both the vesicle (v-SNARE) and the target membrane (t-SNARE)1. In yeast, four integral membrane proteins, Sed5, Bos1, Sec22 and Bet1 (refs 2, 3,4,5,6), each probably contribute a single helix to form the SNARE complex that is needed for transport from endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi7,8,9,10,11. This generates a four-helix bundle12, which ultimately mediates the actual fusion event13. Here we explore how the anchoring arrangement of the four helices affects their ability to mediate fusion. We reconstituted two populations of phospholipid bilayer vesicles, with the individual SNARE proteins distributed in all possible combinations between them. Of the eight non-redundant permutations of four subunits distributed over two vesicle populations, only one results in membrane fusion. Fusion only occurs when the v-SNARE Bet1 is on one membrane and the syntaxin heavy chain Sed5 and its two light chains, Bos1 and Sec22, are on the other membrane where they form a functional t-SNARE. Thus, each SNARE protein is topologically restricted by design to function either as a v-SNARE or as part of a t-SNARE complex.},

GPI-anchored proteins are structurally and functionally diverse and play vital roles in numerous biological processes. While several GPI-anchored proteins have been characterized, the biological functions of the GPI anchor have yet to be elucidated at a molecular level. This review discusses the structural diversity of the GPI anchor and its putative cellular functions, including involvement in lipid raft partitioning, signal transduction, targeting to the apical membrane, and prion disease pathogenesis. We specifically highlight studies in which chemically synthesized GPI anchors and analogues have been employed to study the roles of this unique posttranslational modification.},

These observations prompted the idea that Golgi enzymes constitutively recycle through the ER. We have tested this hypothesis under physiological conditions through use of a procedure that captures Golgi enzymes in the ER. In the presence of rapamycin, which induces a tight association between FKBP (FK506-binding protein) and FRAP (FKBP-rapamycin\textendash associated protein), an FKBP-tagged Golgi enzyme can be trapped when it visits the ER by an ER-retained protein fused to FRAP. We find that although FKBP-ERGIC-53 of the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) rapidly cycles through the ER (30 min), FKBP-Golgi enzyme chimeras remain stably associated with Golgi membranes. We also demonstrate that Golgi dispersion upon nocodazole treatment mainly occurs through a mechanism that does not involve the recycling of Golgi membranes through the ER. Our findings suggest that the Golgi apparatus, as defined by its collection of resident enzymes, exists independent of the ER.},

The trained networks correctly classified 88\% of Arabidopsis and 85\% of vertebrate AUG triplets. We find that our trained neural networks use a combination of local start codon context and global sequence information. Furthermore, analysis of false predictions shows that AUGs in frame with the actual start codon are more frequently selected than out-of-frame AUGs, suggesting that our networks use reading frame detection.

Here, we show that various mutant forms of Sly1p and the Golgi-localized syntaxin Sed5p, which abolish their high-affinity interaction, are fully functional in vivo, indicating that the tight interaction of the two molecules per se is not relevant for proper function. Mutant Sly1p unable to bind Sed5p is excluded from core SNARE complexes, also demonstrating that Sly1p function is not directly coupled to assembled SNARE complexes thought to execute membrane fusion. We also find that wild-type Sly1p and mutant Sly1p unable to bind Sed5p directly interact with selected ER-to-Golgi and intra-Golgi nonsyntaxin SNAREs. The newly identified, direct interactions of the SM protein with nonsytaxin SNAREs might provide a molecular mechanism by which SNAREs can be activated to engage in pairing and assemble into fusogenic SNARE complexes.},

Using affinity chromatography and two-hybrid analyses, we found that the essential COPII component Sec24p, but not Sec23p, binds to the cis-Golgi syntaxin Sed5p. Sec24p/Sed5p interaction in vitro was not dependent on the presence of [Sar1p{$\cdot$}GTP]. The binding of Sec24p to Sed5p is specific; none of the other seven yeast syntaxins bound to this COPII component. Whereas the interaction site of Sec23p is within the N-terminal half of the 926-aa-long Sec24p (amino acid residues 56\textendash 549), Sed5p binds to the N- and C-terminal halves of the protein. Destruction by mutagenesis of a potential zinc finger within the N-terminal half of Sec24p led to a nonfunctional protein that was still able to bind Sec23p and Sed5p.

Reinvestigation of the metal ion dependence of this enzyme has shown that Zn2+, Cd2+, Fe2+, Co2+, and Pr3+ also produce activation, although with lower activities at saturation than that attained with Mn2+. Velocity against metal ion concentration curves for all metals, including Mn2+, are sigmoid, suggesting the presence of two or more activating metal binding sites on the enzyme. The presence of two sites is confirmed by studies using both Mn2+ and Ca2+. While galactosyltransferase is inactive in the presence of Ca2+ alone, at low concentrations of Mn2+ (10(-5) M), enzyme activity is stimulated by Ca2+. A more detailed investigation by steady state kinetics has revealed that there is a tight binding site for Mn2+ (site I: Kd of 2 X 10(-6) M) from which Ca2+ is excluded, and a site at which Ca2+ can replace Mn2+ (site II: Kd for Ca2+ of 1.76 X 10(-3) M), to which metal binding has a specific synergistic effect on UDP-galactose binding, possibly as a result of the formation of an enzyme-Ca2+-UDP-galactose bridge complex. The site I Mn2+, site II Ca2+-activated enzyme has a maximum velocity similar to that of the Mn2+-activated enzyme, and is the enzyme form that must act in lactose synthesis in vivo. A trypsin-degraded form of galactose transferase (galactosyltransferase-T) (Powell, J.T., and Brew, K. (1974) Eur. J.

Methods From epilepsy, movement disorder and genetic clinics 43 patients suffering from progressive myoclonus epilepsy/ataxia were screened for defects in GOSR2, SCARB2 and CSTB.

Membrin is a ubiquitous and essential protein mediating ER-to-Golgi membrane fusion. Thus, it is unclear how mutations in Membrin result in a disorder restricted to the nervous system. Here, we use a multi-layered strategy to elucidate the consequences of Membrin mutations from protein to neuron. We show that the pathogenic mutations cause partial reductions in SNARE-mediated membrane fusion. Importantly, these alterations were sufficient to profoundly impair dendritic growth in Drosophila models of GOSR2-PME. Furthermore, we show that Membrin mutations cause fragmentation of the presynaptic cytoskeleton coupled with transsynaptic instability and hyperactive neurotransmission. Our study highlights how dendritic growth is vulnerable even to subtle secretory pathway deficits, uncovers a role for Membrin in synaptic function, and provides a comprehensive explanatory basis for genotype-phenotype relationships in GOSR2-PME.},

Traditional approaches have elucidated the biochemical requirements for such transport and have established a role for transport intermediates. New techniques for tagging proteins fluorescently have made it possible to follow the complete life history of single transport intermediates in living cells, including their formation, path and velocity en route to the Golgi complex. We have now visualized ER-to-Golgi transport using the viral glycoprotein ts045 VSVG tagged with green fluorescent protein (VSVG-GFP). Upon export from the ER, VSVG-GFP became concentrated in many differently shaped, rapidly forming pre-Golgi structures, which translocated inwards towards the Golgi complex along microtubules by using the microtubule minus-end-directed motor complex of dynein/dynactin. No loss of fluorescent material from pre-Golgi structures occurred during their translocation to the Golgi complex and they frequently stretched into tubular shapes. Together, our results indicate that these pre-Golgi carrier structures moving unidirectionally along microtubule tracks are responsible for transporting VSVG-GFP through the cytoplasm to the Golgi complex. This contrasts with the traditional focus on small vesicles as the primary vehicles for ER-to-Golgi transport.},

Quantitative methodologies using chimeric GFP fusions have been developed for many applications; however, GFP is somewhat resistant to proteolysis, thus its fluorescence persists in the lysosome/vacuole, which can impede quantification of cargo trafficking in the endocytic pathway. An alternative method for quantifying endocytosis and post-endocytic trafficking events makes use of superecliptic pHluorin, a pH-sensitive variant of GFP that is quenched in acidic environments. Chimeric fusion of pHluorin to the cytoplasmic tail of transmembrane cargo proteins results in a dampening of fluorescence upon incorporation of the cargo into multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and delivery to the lysosome/vacuole lumen. Thus, quenching of vacuolar fluorescence facilitates quantification of endocytosis and early events in the endocytic pathway. This paper describes methods using pHluorin-tagged cargos for quantification of endocytosis via fluorescence microscopy, as well as population-based assays using flow cytometry.},

In this secretion pathway, several intracellular ER- or Golgi-resident transmembrane proteins serve as cargo receptors. ER\textendash Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC)-53, VIP36 and VIPL, which have an L-type lectin domain within the luminal portion, participate in the vectorial transport of glycoproteins via sugar\textendash protein interactions. To understand the nature of these receptors, monoclonal antibodies were generated against human ERGIC-53, VIP36 and VIPL using 293T cells expressing these receptors on cell surfaces. These cells were used to immunize rats and for screening antibody-producing clones. Flow cytometric analysis and immunoprecipitation studies showed that the obtained monoclonal antibodies bound specifically to the corresponding cargo receptors. Immunostaining of HeLa cells using the monoclonal antibodies showed that the localization of ERGIC-53 changed from relatively broad distribution in both the ER and the Golgi under normal conditions to a compact distribution in the Golgi under ER stress conditions. This redistribution was also observed by the overexpression of ERGIC-53 and abrogated by co-expression with VIPL but not VIP36. Real-time polymerase chain reaction revealed that ERGIC-53 along with several chaperone proteins was up-regulated after tunicamycin treatment; however, the expression of VIPL was unchanged. Furthermore, ERGIC-53 co-precipitated with VIPL but not VIP36, indicating that ERGIC-53 may interact with VIPL in the ER, which may regulate the localization of ERGIC-53 inside cells. Taken together, these observations provide new insights into the regulation of these cargo receptors and the quality control of glycoproteins within cells.},

Extracellular acidification is crucial for osteoclastic bone resorption, a process that initiates the dissolution of mineralized bone matrix. While the importance of V-ATPases in osteoclastic resorptive function is well-defined, whether V-ATPases facilitate additional aspects of osteoclast function and/or formation remains largely obscure. Here we report that the V-ATPase accessory subunit Ac45 participates in both osteoclast formation and function. Using a siRNA-based approach, we show that targeted suppression of Ac45 impairs intracellular acidification and endocytosis, both are prerequisite for osteoclastic bone resorptive function in vitro. Interestingly, we find that knockdown of Ac45 also attenuates osteoclastogenesis owing to a reduced fusion capacity of osteoclastic precursor cells. Finally, in an effort to gain more detailed insights into the functional role of Ac45 in osteoclasts, we attempted to generate osteoclast-specific Ac45 conditional knockout mice using a Cathepsin K-Cre-LoxP system. Surprisingly, however, insertion of the neomycin cassette in the Ac45-FloxNeo mice resulted in marked disturbances in CNS development and ensuing embryonic lethality thus precluding functional assessment of Ac45 in osteoclasts and peripheral bone tissues. Based on these unexpected findings we propose that, in addition to its canonical function in V-ATPase-mediated acidification, Ac45 plays versatile roles during osteoclast formation and function.},

Proteins that induce curvature of the Golgi membrane are predicted to be required, by analogy to vesicle budding from other membranes. Here, we demonstrate that GOLPH3, upon binding to the phosphoinositide PI4P, induces curvature of synthetic membranes \emph{in vitro} and the Golgi in cells. Moreover, efficient Golgi-to-plasma membrane trafficking critically depends on the ability of GOLPH3 to curve the Golgi membrane. Interestingly, uncoupling of GOLPH3 from its binding partner MYO18A results in extensive curvature of Golgi membranes, producing dramatic tubulation of the Golgi, but does not support forward trafficking.

  abstract = {Excessive skin wrinkling and cutis laxa are seen in many genetic conditions and overlapping features can make a clinical diagnosis difficult. Here we report on 22 Omani patients from 11 consanguineous families with the diagnosis of wrinkly skin syndrome (WSS, OMIM 278250) or geroderma osteodysplasticum hereditaria (GO, OMIM 231070). The WSS phenotype evolves during early childhood and includes a generalized and excessive skin wrinkling, dental problems, herniae, foot deformities, hip dislocations, growth retardation, and a large anterior fontanelle. The facial gestalt is characterized by a broad nasal bridge, hypertelorism, and downslanting palpebral fissures. We were unable to differentiate between WSS and cutis laxa with growth and developmental delay (CLGDD, OMIM 219200) suggesting that both can be considered as one entity. Distinct hallmarks of GO were skin wrinkling limited to the dorsum of hands and feet and to the abdomen, normal fontanelles, maxillary hypoplasia, bowed long bones, and osteopenia with frequent fractures. In contrast to the attenuation of the skin phenotype with age in WSS, adult patients with GO appeared prematurely aged. A serum sialotransferrin type 2 pattern was found in all four WSS patients tested. Apolipoprotein CIII (a marker for O-glycosylation) was normal suggesting that WSS is frequently associated with a N-protein glycosylation defect, probably at the level of processing (CDG-II). All four investigated GO patients showed normal sialotransferrin patterns. The known loci for cutis laxa and WSS on 2q31, 5q23-q31, 7q11, 11q13, and 14q32 were excluded. We suggest that WSS and GO are distinct entities with overlapping features. \textcopyright{} 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

The RNA-guided Cas9 nuclease from the microbial clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) adaptive immune system can be used to facilitate efficient genome engineering in eukaryotic cells by simply specifying a 20-nt targeting sequence within its guide RNA. Here we describe a set of tools for Cas9-mediated genome editing via nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology-directed repair (HDR) in mammalian cells, as well as generation of modified cell lines for downstream functional studies. To minimize off-target cleavage, we further describe a double-nicking strategy using the Cas9 nickase mutant with paired guide RNAs. This protocol provides experimentally derived guidelines for the selection of target sites, evaluation of cleavage efficiency and analysis of off-target activity. Beginning with target design, gene modifications can be achieved within as little as 1\textendash 2 weeks, and modified clonal cell lines can be derived within 2\textendash 3 weeks.},

How do these components come together to produce a transport carrier commensurate with the bulky cargo collagen? TANGO1 is known to form a ring that corrals COPII coats, and we show here how this ring or fence is assembled. Our data reveal that a TANGO1 ring is organized by its radial interaction with COPII, and lateral interactions with cTAGE5, TANGO1-short or itself. Of particular interest is the finding that TANGO1 recruits ERGIC membranes for collagen export via the NRZ (NBAS/RINT1/ZW10) tether complex. Therefore, TANGO1 couples retrograde membrane flow to anterograde cargo transport. Without the NRZ complex, the TANGO1 ring does not assemble, suggesting its role in nucleating or stabilising this process. Thus, coordinated capture of COPII coats, cTAGE5, TANGO1-short, and tethers by TANGO1 assembles a collagen export machine at the ER.},

  abstract = {Intracellular membrane fusion is mediated by the concerted action of N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) and Sec1/Munc18 (SM) proteins. During fusion, SM proteins bind the N-terminal peptide (N-peptide) motif of the SNARE subunit syntaxin, but the function of this interaction is unknown. Here, using FRET-based biochemical reconstitution and Caenorhabditis elegans genetics, we show that the N-peptide of syntaxin-1 recruits the SM protein Munc18-1/nSec1 to the SNARE bundle, facilitating their assembly into a fusion-competent complex. The recruitment is achieved through physical tethering rather than allosteric activation of Munc18-1. Consistent with the recruitment role, the N-peptide is not spatially constrained along syntaxin-1, and it is functional when translocated to another SNARE subunit SNAP-25 or even when simply anchored in the target membrane. The N-peptide function is restricted to an early initiation stage of the fusion reaction. After association, Munc18-1 and the SNARE bundle together drive membrane merging without further involving the N-peptide. Thus, the syntaxin N-peptide is an initiation factor for the assembly of the SNARE-SM membrane fusion complex.},

Nonetheless, current live cell super-resolution microscopy studies generally rely on the overexpression of a host protein fused to a fluorescent protein. Here, we establish CRISPR/Cas9-mediated generation of heterozygous and homozygous human knockin cell lines expressing fluorescently tagged proteins from their respective native genomic loci at close to endogenous levels. We tagged three different proteins, exhibiting various localizations and expression levels, with the reversibly switchable fluorescent protein rsEGFP2. We demonstrate the benefit of endogenous expression levels compared to overexpression and show that typical overexpression-induced artefacts were avoided in genome-edited cells. Fluorescence activated cell sorting analysis revealed a narrow distribution of fusion protein expression levels in genome-edited cells, compared to a pronounced variability in transiently transfected cells. Using low light intensity RESOLFT (reversible saturable optical fluorescence transitions) nanoscopy we show sub-diffraction resolution imaging of living human knockin cells. Our strategy to generate human cell lines expressing fluorescent fusion proteins at endogenous levels for RESOLFT nanoscopy can be extended to other fluorescent tags and super-resolution approaches.},

A pH-sensitive GFP variant, the so-called pHluorin, has proven to be a valuable tool to study the pH of the cytosol, mitochondria and other organelles in vivo. We found that the fluorescence intensity of Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)-targeted pHluorin in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was very low and barely showed pH sensitivity, probably due to misfolding in the oxidative environment of the ER. We therefore developed a superfolder variant of pHluorin which enabled us to monitor pH changes in the ER and the cytosol of S. cerevisiae in vivo. The superfolder pHluorin variant is likely to be functional in cells of different organisms as well as in additional compartments that originate from the secretory pathway like the Golgi apparatus and pre-vacuolar compartments, and therefore has a broad range of possible future applications.},

ARF4 depletion preserves viability, Golgi integrity and cargo trafficking in the presence of BFA, and these effects depend on the guanine nucleotide exchange factor GBF1 and other ARF isoforms including ARF1 and ARF5. ARF4 knockdown cells show increased resistance to several human pathogens including Chlamydia trachomatis and Shigella flexneri. Furthermore, ARF4 expression is induced when cells are exposed to several Golgi-disturbing agents and requires the CREB3 (also known as Luman or LZIP) transcription factor, whose downregulation mimics ARF4 loss.

Reduced autophagic activity has been shown to lead to the accumulation of misfolded proteins in neurons and might be involved in chronic neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we uncover an essential role for the syntaxin-5 SNARE complex in autophagy. Using genetic knockdown, we show that the syntaxin-5 SNARE complex regulates the later stages of autophagy after the initial formation of autophagosomes. This SNARE complex acts on autophagy by regulating ER-to-Golgi transport through the secretory pathway, which is essential for the activity of lysosomal proteases such as cathepsins. Depletion of syntaxin-5 complex components results in the accumulation of autophagosomes as a result of lysosomal dysfunction, leading to decreased degradation of autophagic substrates. Our findings provide a novel link between a fundamental process such as intracellular trafficking and human diseases that might be affected by defective biogenesis and/or homeostasis of the autophagosome\textendash lysosome degradation system.},

Defective O-mannosylation leads to a group of muscular dystrophies, called dystroglycanopathies. Mutations in isoprenoid synthase domain containing (ISPD) represent the second most common cause~of these disorders, however, its molecular function remains uncharacterized. The human ISPD (hISPD) crystal structure showed a canonical N-terminal cytidyltransferase domain linked to a C-terminal domain that is absent in cytidyltransferase homologs. Functional studies demonstrated cytosolic localization of hISPD, and cytidyltransferase activity toward pentose phosphates, including ribulose~5-phosphate, ribose 5-phosphate, and ribitol 5-phosphate. Identity of the CDP sugars was confirmed by liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Our combined results indicate that hISPD~is a cytidyltransferase, suggesting the presence of a novel human nucleotide sugar essential for functional {$\alpha$}-dystroglycan O-mannosylation in muscle and brain. Thereby, ISPD deficiency can be added to the growing list of tertiary dystroglycanopathies.},

This can be achieved by monitoring posttranslational modifications that occur naturally within the secretory pathway, or by measuring the delivery of cargo to the cell surface or extracellular medium. These approaches can be combined with additional manipulations such as specific temperature blocks that permit analysis of distinct trafficking steps. Biochemical analysis is advantageous in that it permits both a sensitive and quantitative measure of trafficking along the pathway. The methods discussed in this chapter permit the analysis of trafficking of both endogenous cargo proteins and ectopically expressed model cargos, which can be followed using either Western blotting or metabolic pulse-chase approaches. These methods are relatively straightforward and suitable for use in most modern cell biology laboratories. In addition to the well-established methods that we describe here in detail, we also refer to the development of more recent tailored approaches that add further to the arsenal of tools that can be used to assess trafficking in the secretory pathway. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {Golgins are coiled-coil proteins that participate in membrane-tethering events at the Golgi complex. Golgin-mediated tethering is thought to be important for vesicular trafficking and Golgi organization. However, the degree to which individual golgins contribute to these processes is poorly defined, and it has been proposed that golgins act in a largely redundant manner. Previous studies on the golgin GMAP-210 (also known as TRIP11), which is mutated in the rare skeletal disorder achondrogenesis type 1A, have yielded conflicting results regarding its involvement in trafficking. Here, we re-investigated the trafficking role of GMAP-210, and found that it is indeed required for efficient trafficking in the secretory pathway. GMAP-210 acts at both the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-to-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and Golgi complex during anterograde trafficking, and is also required for retrograde trafficking to the ER. Using co-depletion experiments, we also found that GMAP-210 acts in a partially redundant manner with the golgin GM130 to ensure efficient anterograde cargo delivery to the cis-Golgi. In summary, our results indicate a role for GMAP-210 in several trafficking steps at the ER-Golgi interface, some of which are partially redundant with another golgin, namely GM130 (also known as GOLGA2).},

Here, we report the 3.5-\AA{} resolution cryoEM structure of the lipid nanodisc-reconstituted Vo proton channel of the yeast vacuolar H+-ATPase, captured in a physiologically relevant, autoinhibited state. The resulting atomic model provides structural detail for the amino acids that constitute the proton pathway at the interface of the proteolipid ring and subunit a. Based on the structure and previous mutagenesis studies, we propose the chemical basis of transmembrane proton transport. Moreover, we discovered that the C terminus of the assembly factor Voa1 is an integral component of mature Vo. Voa1's C-terminal transmembrane {$\alpha$} helix is bound inside the proteolipid ring, where it contributes to the stability of the complex. Our structure rationalizes possible mechanisms by which mutations in human Vo can result in disease phenotypes and may thus provide new avenues for therapeutic interventions.},

Clathrin-coated vesicles have been purified from CHO cells infected with vesicular stomatitis virus and shown to contain G protein in amounts nearly stoichiometric with clathrin. Pulse-chase experiments have demonstrated that this G protein is a transit form and have revealed that G is transported to the cell surface in two successive waves of coated vesicles. The oligosaccharides of G1 protein carried in the early wave are of the "high-mannose" variety which can be cleaved by the enzyme endoglycosidase H; the oligosaccharides of G2 protein in the second, later wave are resistant to endoglycosidase H. The early wave is therefore proposed to correspond to transport of G protein in coated vesicles from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus, where the oligosaccharides are processed and resistance to endoglycosidase H is conferred; the succeeding wave would represent transport from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane.},

BioID features proximity-dependent biotinylation of proteins that are near-neighbors of the fusion protein. Biotinylated proteins may be isolated by affinity capture and identified by mass spectrometry. We apply BioID to lamin-A (LaA), a well-characterized intermediate filament protein that is a constituent of the nuclear lamina, an important structural element of the nuclear envelope (NE). We identify multiple proteins that associate with and/or are proximate to LaA in vivo. The most abundant of these include known interactors of LaA that are localized to the NE, as well as a new NE-associated protein named SLAP75. Our results suggest BioID is a useful and generally applicable method to screen for both interacting and neighboring proteins in their native cellular environment.},

OST isoforms with different catalytic subunits (STT3A versus STT3B) and distinct enzymatic properties are coexpressed in mammalian cells. Using siRNA to achieve isoform-specific knockdowns, we show that the OST isoforms cooperate and act sequentially to mediate protein N-glycosylation. The STT3A OST isoform is primarily responsible for cotranslational glycosylation of the nascent polypeptide as it enters the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. The STT3B isoform is required for efficient cotranslational glycosylation of an acceptor site adjacent to the N-terminal signal sequence of a secreted protein. Unlike STT3A, STT3B efficiently mediates posttranslational glycosylation of~a carboxyl-terminal glycosylation site in an unfolded protein. These distinct and complementary roles for the OST isoforms allow sequential scanning of polypeptides for acceptor sites to insure the maximal efficiency of N-glycosylation.},

We show that ATP6AP2 deficiency in the mouse liver caused hypoglycosylation of serum proteins and autophagy defects. The introduction of one of the missense mutations into Drosophila led to reduced survival and altered lipid metabolism. We further demonstrate that in the liver-like fat body, the autophagic dysregulation was associated with defects in lysosomal acidification and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. Finally, both ATP6AP2 mutations impaired protein stability and the interaction with ATP6AP1, a member of the V0 assembly complex. Collectively, our data suggest that the missense mutations in ATP6AP2 lead to impaired V-ATPase assembly and subsequent defects in glycosylation and autophagy.},

Deficiency of a COG-subunit leads to defective protein glycosylation, and thus Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDG). Mutations in subunits 1, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 have been associated with CDG-II. The first patient with COG5-CDG was recently described (Paesold-Burda et al. Hum Mol Genet 2009; 18:4350-6). Contrary to most other COG-CDG cases, the patient presented a mild/moderate phenotype, i.e. moderate psychomotor retardation with language delay, truncal ataxia and slight hypotonia. METHODS: CDG-IIx patients from our database were screened for mutations in COG5. Clinical data were compared. Brefeldin A treatment of fibroblasts and immunoblotting experiments were performed to support the diagnosis. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: We identified five new patients with proven COG5 deficiency. We conclude that the clinical picture is not always as mild as previously described. It rather comprises a broad spectrum with phenotypes ranging from mild to very severe. Interestingly, on a clinical basis some of the patients present a significant overlap with COG7-CDG, a finding which can probably be explained by subunit interactions at the protein level.},

Mutations in all COG subunits, except subunit 3, have been detected in patients with congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) of variable severity. So far, 3 families with a total of 10 individuals with biallelic COG6 mutations have been described, showing a broad clinical spectrum. Here we present 7 additional patients with 4 novel COG6 mutations. In spite of clinical variability, we delineate the core features of COG6-CDG i.e. liver involvement (9/10), microcephaly (8/10), developmental disability (8/10), recurrent infections (7/10), early lethality (6/10), and hypohidrosis predisposing for hyperthermia (6/10) and hyperkeratosis (4/10) as ectodermal signs. Regarding all COG6-related disorders a genotype-phenotype correlation can be discerned ranging from deep intronic mutations found in Shaheen syndrome as the mildest form to loss-of-function mutations leading to early lethal CDG phenotypes. A comparison with other COG deficiencies suggests ectodermal changes to be a hallmark of COG6-related disorders. Our findings aid clinical differentiation of this complex group of disorders and imply subtle functional differences between the COG complex subunits.},

In the acidic milieu of the Golgi, its C-terminal tail changes conformation, simultaneously exposing the substrate-binding site for cargo capture and the RDEL motif for ER retrieval through interactions with cognate receptors. Protonation of cysteine 29 in the active site allows tail movements in vitro and in vivo. Here, we show that conserved histidine residues in the C-terminal tail also regulate ERp44 in vivo. Mutants lacking these histidine residues retain substrates more efficiently. Surprisingly, they are also O-glycosylated and partially secreted. Co-expression of client proteins prevents secretion of the histidine mutants, forcing tail opening and RDEL accessibility. Client-induced RDEL exposure allows retrieval of proteins from distinct stations along the secretory pathway, as indicated by the changes in O-glycosylation patterns upon overexpression of different partners. The ensuing gradients might help to optimize folding and assembly of different cargoes. Endogenous ERp44 is O-glycosylated and secreted by human primary endometrial cells, suggesting possible pathophysiological roles of these processes.},

Moreover residues 1214-1396, that include the first coiled coil of TANGO1, specifically recruit ERGIC membranes even when targeted to mitochondria. TANGO1 is thus pivotal in concentrating procollagen VII in the lumen and recruiting ERGIC membranes on the cytoplasmic surface of the ER.

  abstract = {Golgins are extended coiled-coil proteins believed to participate in membrane-tethering events at the Golgi apparatus. However, the importance of golgin-mediated tethering remains poorly defined, and alternative functions for golgins have been proposed. Moreover, although golgins bind to Rab GTPases, the functional significance of Rab binding has yet to be determined. In this study, we show that depletion of the golgin GMAP-210 causes a loss of Golgi cisternae and accumulation of numerous vesicles. GMAP-210 function in vivo is dependent upon its ability to tether membranes, which is mediated exclusively by the amino-terminal ALPS motif. Binding to Rab2 is also important for GMAP-210 function, although it is dispensable for tethering per se. GMAP-210 length is also functionally important in vivo. Together our results indicate a key role for GMAP-210\textendash mediated membrane tethering in maintaining Golgi structure and support a role for Rab2 binding in linking tethering with downstream docking and fusion events at the Golgi apparatus.},

  abstract = {Golgins are a family of Golgi-localized long coiled-coil proteins. The major golgin function is thought to be the tethering of vesicles, membranes, and cytoskeletal elements to the Golgi. We previously showed that knockdown of one of the longest golgins, Giantin, altered the glycosylation patterns of cell surfaces and the kinetics of cargo transport, suggesting that Giantin maintains correct glycosylation through slowing down transport within the Golgi. Giantin knockdown also altered the sizes and numbers of mini Golgi stacks generated by microtubule de-polymerization, suggesting that it maintains the independence of individual Golgi stacks. Therefore, it is presumed that Golgi stacks lose their independence following Giantin knockdown, allowing easier and possibly increased transport among stacks and abnormal glycosylation. To gain structural insights into the independence of Golgi stacks, we herein performed electron tomography and 3D modeling of Golgi stacks in Giantin knockdown cells. Compared with control cells, Giantin-knockdown cells had fewer fenestrae within each cisterna. This was supported by data showing that the diffusion rate of Golgi membrane proteins is faster in Giantin-knockdown Golgi, indicating that Giantin knockdown structurally and functionally increases connectivity among Golgi cisternae and stacks. This increased connectivity suggests that contrary to current understanding, Giantin instead inhibits the tether and fusion of nearby Golgi cisternae and stacks, resulting in transport difficulties between stacks that may enable the correct glycosylation of proteins and lipids passing through the Golgi.},

Here, we report the function of a SNARE, Syntaxin 5 (Syx5), in the development of photoreceptors in Drosophila. In wild-type photoreceptors, Syx5 localizes to cis-Golgi, along with cis-Golgi markers: Rab1 and GM130. We observed that Syx5-deficient photoreceptors show notable accumulation of these cis-Golgi markers accompanying drastic accumulation of vesicles between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi cisternae. Extensive analysis of Rh1 (rhodopsin 1) trafficking revealed that in Syx5-deficient photoreceptors, Rh1 is exported from the ER with normal kinetics, retained in the cis-Golgi region along with GM130 for a prolonged period, and then subsequently degraded presumably by endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD) after retrieval to the ER. Unlike our previous report of Rab6-deficient photoreceptors \textendash{} where two apical transport pathways are specifically inhibited \textendash{} vesicle transport pathways to all plasma membrane domains are inhibited in Syx5-deficient photoreceptors, implying that Rab6 and Syx5 are acting in different steps of intra-Golgi transport. These results indicate that Syx5 is crucial for membrane protein transport, presumably during ER-derived vesicle fusion to form cis-Golgi cisternae.},

Among the four isoforms (a1\textendash a4) of subunit Voa, the isoform(s) critical for secretory vesicle acidification have yet to be identified. An independent function of Voa1 in exocytosis has been suggested. Here we investigate the function of Voa isoforms in secretory vesicle acidification and exocytosis by using neurosecretory PC12 cells. Fluorescence-tagged and endogenous Voa1 are primarily localized on secretory vesicles, whereas fluorescence-tagged Voa2 and Voa3 are enriched on the Golgi and early endosomes, respectively. To elucidate the functional roles of Voa1 and Voa2, we engineered PC12 cells in which Voa1, Voa2, or both are stably down-regulated. Our results reveal significant reductions in the acidification and transmitter uptake/storage of dense-core vesicles by knockdown of Voa1 and more dramatically of Voa1/Voa2 but not of Voa2. Overexpressing knockdown-resistant Voa1 suppresses the acidification defect caused by the Voa1/Voa2 knockdown. Unexpectedly, Ca2+-dependent peptide secretion is largely unaffected in Voa1 or Voa1/Voa2 knockdown cells. Our data demonstrate that Voa1 and Voa2 cooperatively regulate the acidification and transmitter uptake/storage of dense-core vesicles, whereas they might not be as critical for exocytosis as recently proposed.},

  abstract = {Golgi stress response is emerging as a physiologic process of comparable importance to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondrial stress responses. However, unlike ER stress, the identity of the signal transduction pathway involved in the Golgi stress response has been elusive. We show that the Golgi stressor monensin acts via the PKR-like ER kinase/Activating Transcription Factor 4 pathway. ATF4 is the master regulator of amino acid metabolism, which is induced during amino acid depletion and other forms of stress. One of the genes regulated by ATF4 is the biosynthetic enzyme for cysteine, cystathionine {$\gamma$}-lyase (CSE), which also plays central roles in maintenance of redox homeostasis. Huntington's disease (HD), a neurodegenerative disorder, is associated with disrupted cysteine metabolism caused by depletion of CSE leading to abnormal redox balance and stress response. Thus, restoring CSE function and cysteine disposition may be beneficial in HD. Accordingly, we harnessed the monensin-ATF4\textendash signaling cascade to stimulate CSE expression by preconditioning cells with monensin, which restores cysteine metabolism and an optimal stress response in HD. These findings have implications for treatment of HD and other diseases associated with redox imbalance and dysregulated ATF4 signaling.},

  abstract = {The factors contributing to the establishment of the steady state Golgi pH (pH(G)) were studied in intact and permeabilized mammalian cells by fluorescence ratio imaging. Retrograde transport of the nontoxic B subunit of verotoxin 1 was used to deliver pH-sensitive probes to the Golgi complex. To evaluate whether counter-ion permeability limited the activity of the electrogenic V-ATPase, we determined the concentration of K(+) in the lumen of the Golgi using a null point titration method. The [K(+)] inside the Golgi was found to be close to that of the cytosol, and increasing its permeability had no effect on pH(G). Moreover, the capacity of the endogenous counter-ion permeability exceeded the rate of H(+) pumping, implying that the potential across the Golgi membrane is negligible and has little influence on pH(G). The V-ATPase does not reach thermodynamic equilibrium nor does it seem to be allosterically inactivated at the steady state pH(G). In fact, active H(+) pumping was detectable even below the resting pH(G). A steady state pH was attained when the rate of pumping was matched by the passive backflux of H(+) (equivalents) or "leak." The nature of this leak pathway was investigated in detail. Neither vesicular traffic nor H(+)/cation antiporters or symporters were found to contribute to the net loss of H(+) from the Golgi. Instead, the leak was sensitive to voltage changes and was inhibited by Zn(2+), resembling the H(+) conductive pathway of the plasma membrane. We conclude that a balance between an endogenous leak, which includes a conductive component, and the H(+) pump determines the pH at which the Golgi lumen attains a steady state.},

However, its metabolism is not well understood. Here, we demonstrate the presence of endogenous NAADP in HeLa cells. CD38, a promiscuous enzyme described to be involved in NAADP metabolism, was not detectable in HeLa cells. In cell-free extracts of HeLa cells, NAADP was degraded to nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NAAD). The enzyme was enriched in membranes (10,000 \texttimes{} g pellet) and displayed characteristics typical of alkaline phosphatase (AP), e.g. pH optimum at 8-9 and sensitivity to the inhibitors L-homoarginine and L-leucine. Importantly, NAADP at physiological concentrations (50-100 nM) was degraded to NAAD. Expression of AP isoenzymes was analyzed in HeLa cells. Based on the results together with inhibitor studies, the placental AP isoform emerged as the best candidate for NAADP degradation in HeLa cells. In contrast to HeLa cells, Jurkat T cells or HEK293 cells did not express any AP isoenzymes and did not display any NAADP 2'-phosphatase activity. Finally, the placental AP isoform was expressed heterologously in HEK293 cells, resulting in reconstitution of NAADP 2'-phosphatase activity in cell-free extracts. On the basis of the results, we provide evidence for AP as the metabolizing enzyme of NAADP in cells that do not express CD38.},

  abstract = {The determination of pH in the cell cytoplasm or in intracellular organelles is of high relevance in cell biology. Also in plant cells, organelle-specific pH monitoring with high spatial precision is an important issue, since e.g. {$\Delta$}pH across thylakoid membranes is the driving force for ATP synthesis critically regulating photoprotective mechanisms like non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) of chlorophyll (Chl) fluorescence or the xanthophyll cycle. In animal cells, pH determination can serve to monitor proton permeation across membranes and, therefore, to assay the efficiency of drugs against proton-selective transporters or ion channels. In this work, we demonstrate the applicability of the pH-sensitive GFP derivative (eGFP-pHsens, originally termed deGFP4 by Hanson et al. [1]) for pH measurements using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) with excellent precision. eGFP-pHsens was either expressed in the cytoplasm or targeted to the mitochondria of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells and applied here for monitoring activity of the M2 proton channel from influenza A virus. It is shown that the M2 protein confers high proton permeability of the plasma membrane upon expression in CHO-K1 cells resulting in rapid and strong changes of the intracellular pH upon pH changes of the extracellular medium. These pH changes are abolished in the presence of amantadine, a specific blocker of the M2 proton channel. These results were obtained using a novel multi-parameter FLIM setup that permits the simultaneous imaging of the fluorescence amplitude ratios and lifetimes of eGFP-pHsens enabling the quick and accurate pH determination with spatial resolution of 500nm in two color channels with time resolution of below 100ps. With FLIM, we also demonstrate the simultaneous determination of pH in the cytoplasm and mitochondria showing that the pH in the mitochondrial matrix is slightly higher (around 7.8) than that in the cytoplasm (about 7.0). The results obtained for CHO-K1 cells without M2 channels in comparison to M2-expressing cells show that the pH dynamics is determined by the specific H+ permeability of the membrane, the buffering of protons in the internal cell lumen and/or an outwardly directed proton pump activity that stabilizes the interior pH at a higher level than the external acidic pH.

Here we investigated the expression and localization of all four isoforms in mouse kidney. Real-time PCR detected mRNAs encoding all four `a' isoforms in mouse kidney with a relative abundance in the following order: a4{$>$}a2=a1{$>$}a3. Immunolocalization demonstrated expression of all `a' subunits in the proximal tubule and in the intercalated cells of the collecting system. In intercalated cells a1 and a4 isoforms appeared on both the apical and basolateral side and were expressed in all subtypes of intercalated cells. In contrast, a2, and a3 were only found in the apical membrane. a1 and a4 were colocalized in the same cells with AE1 or pendrin, whereas a2 was only found in AE1 positive cells but absent from pendrin expressing intercalated cells. These results suggest that vacuolar H+-ATPases containing different `a' isoforms may serve specific and distinct functions and may help explaining why loss of the a4 isoform causes only dRTA without an apparent defect in the proximal tubule.},

  abstract = {Skip to Next Section The retromer complex is a vital element of the endosomal protein sorting machinery that is conserved across all eukaryotes. Retromer is most closely associated with the endosome-to-Golgi retrieval pathway and is necessary to maintain an active pool of hydrolase receptors in the trans-Golgi network. Recent progress in studies of retromer have identified new retromer-interacting proteins, including the WASH complex and cargo such as the Wntless/MIG-14 protein, which now extends the role of retromer beyond the endosome-to-Golgi pathway and has revealed that retromer is required for aspects of endosome-to-plasma membrane sorting and regulation of signalling events. The interactions between the retromer complex and other macromolecular protein complexes now show how endosomal protein sorting is coordinated with actin assembly and movement along microtubules, and place retromer squarely at the centre of a complex set of protein machinery that governs endosomal protein sorting. Dysregulation of retromer-mediated endosomal protein sorting leads to various pathologies, including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease and spastic paraplegia and the mechanisms underlying these pathologies are starting to be understood. In this Commentary, I will highlight recent advances in the understanding of retromer-mediated endosomal protein sorting and discuss how retromer contributes to a diverse set of physiological processes.},

Here, we demonstrate that the previously reported inefficient ER trapping of Golgi enzymes in a rapamycin-based assay results from an artifact involving an endogenous ER-localized 13-kD FK506 binding protein (FKBP13) competing with the FKBP12-tagged Golgi enzyme for binding to an FKBP-rapamycin binding domain (FRB)-tagged ER trap. When we express an FKBP12-tagged ER trap and FRB-tagged Golgi enzymes, conditions precluding such competition, the Golgi enzymes completely redistribute to the ER upon rapamycin treatment. A photoactivatable FRB-Golgi enzyme, highlighted only in the Golgi, likewise redistributes to the ER. These data establish Golgi enzymes constitutively cycle through the ER. Using our trapping scheme, we identify roles of rab6a and calcium-independent phospholipase A2 (iPLA2) in Golgi enzyme recycling, and show that retrograde transport of Golgi membrane underlies Golgi dispersal during microtubule depolymerization and mitosis.},

PURPOSE: To describe the clinical and molecular analysis of a large multiplex consanguineous Saudi family with an unusual constellation of severe intellectual disability, hypohidrosis, abnormal teeth, and acquired microcephaly. METHODS: Clinical evaluation, autozygosity mapping, exome sequencing, and expression analysis. RESULTS: Autozygosity mapping revealed a single critical locus corresponding to chr13:39 338 062-40 857 430. Exome sequencing uncovered a deep intronic (NM\_020751.2:c.1167-24A{$>$}G) variant in COG6 that largely replaces the consensus acceptor site, resulting in pronounced reduction of the normal transcript and consequent deficiency of COG6 protein. Patient cells also exhibited pronounced deficiency of STX6, consistent with the established stabilising effect of COG6 on STX6. Four additional patients representing two families of the same tribal origin as the original family were found to have the same mutation, confirming a founder effect. Remarkably, none of the patients displayed any detectable abnormality in the glycosylation pattern of transferrin, which contradicts a previously published report of a patient whose abnormal glycosylation pattern was presumed to be caused by a missense variant in COG6. CONCLUSIONS: Our data implicate COG6 in the pathogenesis of a novel hypohidrotic disorder in humans that is distinct from congenital disorders of glycosylation.},

We used large datasets from both fungi and vertebrates to perform a comprehensive comparison of the TMDs of proteins from different organelles. We find that TMDs are not generic but have organelle-specific properties with a dichotomy in TMD length between the early and late parts of the secretory pathway. In addition, TMDs from post-ER organelles show striking asymmetries in amino acid compositions across the bilayer that is linked to residue size and varies between organelles. The pervasive presence of organelle-specific features among the TMDs of~a particular organelle has implications for TMD prediction, regulation of protein activity by location, and sorting of proteins and lipids in the secretory pathway.},

Here, we analyzed cellular phenotypes at different stages of COG3 KD to uncover the molecular link between COG function and glycosylation disorders. For the first time, we demonstrated that medial-Golgi enzymes are transiently relocated into CCD vesicles in COG3 KD cells. As a result, Golgi modifications of both plasma membrane (CD44) and lysosomal (Lamp2) glycoproteins are distorted. Localization of these proteins is not altered, indicating that the COG complex is not required for anterograde trafficking and accurate sorting. COG7 KD and double COG3/COG7 KD caused similar defects with respect to both Golgi traffic and glycosylation, suggesting that the entire COG complex orchestrates recycling of medial-Golgi-resident proteins. COG complex-dependent docking of isolated CCD vesicles was reconstituted in vitro, supporting their role as functional trafficking intermediates. Altogether, the data suggest that constantly cycling medial-Golgi enzymes are transported from distal compartments in CCD vesicles. Dysfunction of COG complex leads to separation of glycosyltransferases from anterograde cargo molecules passing along secretory pathway, thus affecting normal protein glycosylation.},

We demonstrate that the vesicle tether conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex colocalizes and coimmunoprecipitates with intra-Golgi SNARE molecules. In yeast cells, the COG complex preferentially interacts with the SNARE complexes containing yeast Golgi target (t)-SNARE Sed5p. In mammalian cells, hCog4p and hCog6p interact with Syntaxin5a, the mammalian homologue of Sed5p. Moreover, fluorescence resonance energy transfer reveals an in vivo interaction between Syntaxin5a and the COG complex. Knockdown of the mammalian COG complex decreases Golgi SNARE mobility, produces an accumulation of free Syntaxin5, and decreases the steady-state levels of the intra-Golgi SNARE complex. Finally, overexpression of the hCog4p N-terminal Syntaxin5a-binding domain destabilizes intra-Golgi SNARE complexes, disrupting the Golgi. These data suggest that the COG complex orchestrates vesicular trafficking similarly in yeast and mammalian cells by binding to the t-SNARE Syntaxin5a/Sed5p and enhancing the stability of intra-Golgi SNARE complexes.},

  abstract = {VLDLs (very-low-density lipoproteins) are synthesized in the liver and play an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Following their biogenesis in hepatic ER (endoplasmic reticulum), nascent VLDLs are exported to the Golgi which is a physiologically regulatable event. We have previously shown that a unique ER-derived vesicle, the VTV (VLDL-transport vesicle), mediates the targeted delivery of VLDL to the Golgi lumen. Because VTVs are different from other ER-derived transport vesicles in their morphology and biochemical composition, we speculated that a distinct set of SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor-attachment protein receptor) proteins would form a SNARE complex which would eventually facilitate the docking/fusion of VTVs with Golgi. Our results show that Sec22b is concentrated in VTVs as compared with the ER. Electron microscopic results show that Sec22b co-localizes with p58 and Sar1 on the VTV surface. Pre-treatment of VTV with antibodies against Sec22b inhibited VTV\textendash Golgi fusion, indicating its role as a v-SNARE (vesicle SNARE). To isolate the SNARE complex, we developed an in vitro docking assay in which VTVs were allowed to dock with the Golgi, but fusion was prevented to stabilize the SNARE complex. After the docking reaction, VTV\textendash Golgi complexes were collected, solubilized in 2\% Triton X-100 and the SNARE complex was co-immunoprecipitated using anti-Sec22b or GOS28 antibodies. A \textasciitilde 110~kDa complex was identified in non-boiled samples that was dissociated upon boiling. The components of the complex were identified as Sec22b, syntaxin 5, rBet1 and GOS28. Antibodies against each SNARE component significantly inhibited VTV\textendash Golgi fusion. We conclude that the SNARE complex required for VTV\textendash Golgi fusion is composed of Sec22b, syntaxin 5, rBet1 and GOS28.},

  abstract = {The movement of VLDL [very-LDL (low-density lipoprotein)] from the ER (endoplasmic reticulum) to the Golgi is required for its eventual secretion from hepatocytes and represents a potential target in controlling elevated concentrations of its metabolite LDL, the major determinant of atherosclerosis. To study this process, an in vitro ER-budding assay was developed to examine the generation of the VTV (VLDL transport vesicle) and PTV (protein transport vesicles) using ER isolated from [14C]TAG (triacylglycerol) and [3H]protein-labelled primary rat hepatocytes. VTVs do not contain albumin, as determined by immunoblots. VTVs were distributed in light-density fractions, whereas PTVs were mainly in the mid-portion of the sucrose gradient. Electron microscopy revealed that VTVs were larger ({$\sim$}100\textendash 120~nm) in size than PTVs ({$\sim$}55\textendash 70~nm). ER from 0.4~mM OA (oleic acid)-treated hepatocytes budded VTVs of a lighter density as compared with VTVs budded from ER of 0.1~mM or 0.004~mM OA-treated hepatocytes. The generation of VTVs from rat hepatic ER required cytosol, ATP, Sar1 (a GTPase) and incubation at 37~\textdegree C. Proteinase K treatment did not degrade the VTV cargo protein, apoB100 (apolipoprotein 100), indicating that VTVs were sealed. Immunoblots showed that VTV concentrated apoB100, Sar1 and rSec22b, and excluded albumin and calnexin. VTVs were shown to fuse with cis-Golgi and delivered their cargo to the Golgi lumen, as determined by in vitro fusion, and acquired endoglycosidase H resistance. These results suggest that a new ER-derived transport vesicle (VTV) has been identified and characterized which transports nascent VLDL from the hepatic ER to the Golgi.},

Although recent advances in lipid analytics show that membranes in eukaryotic cells contain hundreds of different lipid species, the function of this lipid diversity remains enigmatic. The basic structure of cell membranes is the lipid bilayer, composed of two apposing leaflets, forming a two-dimensional liquid with fascinating properties designed to perform the functions cells require. To coordinate these functions, the bilayer has evolved the propensity to segregate its constituents laterally. This capability is based on dynamic liquid-liquid immiscibility and underlies the raft concept of membrane subcompartmentalization. This principle combines the potential for sphingolipid-cholesterol self-assembly with protein specificity to focus and regulate membrane bioactivity. Here we will review the emerging principles of membrane architecture with special emphasis on lipid organization and domain formation.},

It has been adopted for gene editing because it can be designed to recognize and cut specific locations in the genome. A challenge in developing clinical applications is the potential for off-target effects that could result in DNA cleavage at the wrong locations. Slaymaker et al. used structure-guided engineering to improve the specificity of Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9). They identified enhanced-specificity variants (eSpCas9) that display reduced off-target cleavage while maintaining robust on-target activity Science, this issue p. 84 The RNA-guided endonuclease Cas9 is a versatile genome-editing tool with a broad range of applications from therapeutics to functional annotation of genes. Cas9 creates double-strand breaks (DSBs) at targeted genomic loci complementary to a short RNA guide. However, Cas9 can cleave off-target sites that are not fully complementary to the guide, which poses a major challenge for genome editing. Here, we use structure-guided protein engineering to improve the specificity of Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9). Using targeted deep sequencing and unbiased whole-genome off-target analysis to assess Cas9-mediated DNA cleavage in human cells, we demonstrate that ``enhanced specificity'' SpCas9 (eSpCas9) variants reduce off-target effects and maintain robust on-target cleavage. Thus, eSpCas9 could be broadly useful for genome-editing applications requiring a high level of specificity. Structure-guided engineering improves the genome editing specificity of the CRISPR-associated endonuclease Cas9.

Here, we examined expression, distribution, and activity of V-ATPase isoforms in invasive prostate adenocarcinoma (PC-3) cells. Isoforms 1 and 3 were the most highly expressed forms of membrane subunit a, with a1 and a3 the dominant plasma membrane isoforms. Correlation between plasma membrane V-ATPase activity and invasiveness was limited, but RNAi knockdown of either a isoform did slow cell proliferation and inhibit invasion in vitro. Isoform a1 was recruited to the cell surface from the early endosome-recycling complex pathway, its knockdown arresting transferrin receptor recycling. Isoform a3 was associated with the late endosomal/lysosomal compartment. Both a isoforms associated with accessory protein Ac45, knockdown of which stalled transit of a1 and transferrin-transferrin receptor, decreased proton efflux, and reduced cell growth and invasiveness; this latter effect was at least partly due to decreased delivery of the membrane-bound matrix metalloproteinase MMP-14 to the plasma membrane. These data indicate that in prostatic carcinoma cells, a1 and a3 isoform populations predominate in different compartments where they maintain different luminal pH. Ac45 plays a central role in navigating the V-ATPase to the plasma membrane, and hence it is an important factor in expression of the invasive phenotype.},

We report on two dysmorphic siblings with severe liver disease who died at the age of a few weeks. Increased activities of lysosomal enzymes in plasma were found, though total sialic acid in plasma was strongly decreased. Isoelectric focusing of serum sialotransferrins showed a type 2-like CDG pattern. Some of the known CDG subtypes were excluded. O-Glycosylation was investigated by isoelectric focusing of apolipoprotein C-III, which showed increased fractions of hyposialylated isoforms. In a consecutive study a defect in the conserved oligomeric Golgi complex was established at the level of subunit COG-7, leading to disruption of multiple glycosylation functions of the Golgi. This report on patients with a new variant of CDG, due to a multiple Golgi defect, emphasizes in addition to sialotransferrins the importance of analysis of a serum O-linked glycoprotein, e.g. apolipoprotein C-III, in unclassified CDG-X cases.},

The interdependence of anterograde and retrograde vesicle trafficking makes the dissection of both processes difficult in vivo. We have developed an in vitro system that measures the retrieval of a soluble reporter protein, the precursor of the yeast pheromone alpha-factor fused to a retrieval signal (HDEL) at its COOH terminus (Dean, N., and H.R.B Pelham. 1990. J. Cell Biol. 111:369-377). Retrieval depends on the HDEL sequence; the alpha-factor precursor, naturally lacking this sequence, is not retrieved. A full cycle of anterograde and retrograde transport requires a simple set of purified cytosolic proteins, including Sec18p, the Lma1p complex, Uso1p, coatomer, and Arf1p. Among the membrane-bound v-SNAP receptor (v-SNARE) proteins, Bos1p is required only for forward transport, Sec22p only for retrograde trafficking, and Bet1p is implicated in both avenues of transport. Putative retrograde carriers (COPI vesicles) generated from Golgi-enriched membranes contain v-SNAREs as well as Emp47p as cargo.},

In addition some proteins may need export chaperones or export receptors to enable their exit into transport vesicles. ER export factors, SNAREs, and misfolded Golgi-resident proteins must all be retrieved from the Golgi to the ER again. This retrieval is also part of the organellar homeostasis pathway essential to maintaining the identity of the ER and of the Golgi apparatus.

Although the transfer of initial sugar(s) to glycoproteins or glycolipids occurs in the ER or on the ER membrane, the subsequent addition of the many different sugars that make up a mature glycan is accomplished in the Golgi. Golgi membranes are studded with glycosyltransferases, glycosidases, and nucleotide sugar transporters arrayed in a generally ordered manner from the cis-Golgi to the trans-Golgi network (TGN), such that each activity is able to act on specific substrate(s) generated earlier in the pathway. The spectrum of glycosyltransferases and other activities that effect glycosylation may vary with cell type, and thus the final complement of glycans on glycoconjugates is variable. In addition, glycan synthesis is affected by Golgi pH, the integrity of Golgi peripheral membrane proteins, growth factor signaling, Golgi membrane dynamics, and cellular stress. Knowledge of Golgi glycosylation has fostered the development of assays to identify mechanisms of intracellular vesicular trafficking and facilitated glycosylation engineering of recombinant glycoproteins.},

Here, we used high-throughput screening to identify small molecule inhibitors that protect cells from ricin and Shiga-like toxins. We identified two compounds that selectively block retrograde toxin trafficking at the early endosome-TGN interface, without affecting compartment morphology, endogenous retrograde cargos, or other trafficking steps, demonstrating an unexpected degree of selectivity and lack of toxicity. In mice, one compound clearly protects from lethal nasal exposure to ricin. Our work discovers the first small molecule that shows efficacy against ricin in animal experiments and identifies the retrograde route as a potential therapeutic target.},

The diversity of mammalian membrane compartments predicts the existence of a large number of different syntaxin and vesicle-associated membrane protein genes. To further investigate the spectrum of SNAREs and their roles in membrane trafficking we characterized three novel members of the syntaxin and SNAP-25 (synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kDa) subfamilies. The proteins are broadly expressed, suggesting a general role in vesicle trafficking, and localize to distinct membrane compartments. Syntaxin 8 co-localizes with markers of the endoplasmic reticulum. Syntaxin 17, a divergent member of the syntaxin family, partially overlaps with endoplasmic reticulum markers, and SNAP-29 is broadly localized on multiple membranes.

Here, we report the X-ray structure of the neuronal SNARE complex, consisting of rat syntaxin 1A, SNAP-25 and synaptobrevin 2, with the carboxy-terminal linkers and transmembrane regions at 3.4 \AA{} resolution. The structure shows that assembly proceeds beyond the already known core SNARE complex7, resulting in a continuous helical bundle that is further stabilized by side-chain interactions in the linker region. Our results suggest that the final phase of SNARE assembly is directly coupled to membrane merger.},

They function in a wide array of normal cellular processes, including membrane traffic, protein processing and degradation, and the coupled transport of small molecules, as well as such physiological processes as urinary acidification and bone resorption. The V-ATPases have also been implicated in a number of disease processes, including viral infection, renal disease, and bone resorption defects. This review is focused on the growing evidence for the important role of V-ATPases in cancer. This includes functions in cellular signaling (particularly Wnt, Notch, and mTOR signaling), cancer cell survival in the highly acidic environment of tumors, aiding the development of drug resistance, as well as crucial roles in tumor cell invasion, migration, and metastasis. Of greatest excitement is evidence that at least some tumors express isoforms of V-ATPase subunits whose disruption is not lethal, leading to the possibility of developing anti-cancer therapeutics that selectively target V-ATPases that function in cancer cells.},

Here we describe an auto-regulatory device that helps to maintain homeostasis of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by adjusting the secretory flux to the cargo load. The cargo-recruiting subunit of the coatomer protein II (COPII) coat, Sec24, doubles as a sensor of folded cargo and, upon cargo binding, acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor to activate the signaling protein G{$\alpha$}12 at the ER exit sites (ERESs). This step, in turn, activates a complex signaling network that activates and coordinates the ER export machinery and attenuates proteins synthesis, thus preventing large fluctuations of folded and potentially active cargo that could be harmful to the cell or the organism. We call this mechanism AREX (autoregulation of ER export) and expect that its identification will aid our understanding of human physiology and diseases that develop from secretory dysfunction.},

We recently found that in the NG108-15 cell line, ER stress upregulates ER\textendash Golgi-soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor-attachment protein receptors (ER\textendash Golgi SNAREs) Syx5 and Bet1. In the present study, we examined the effects of apoptosis and ER stress inducers on the expression of ER\textendash Golgi SNARE proteins and cell viability in a primary culture of rat hippocampal neurons. An apoptosis inducer significantly downregulated the expression of ER\textendash Golgi SNARE Syx5. ER-stress inducers upregulated the expression of Syx5 isoforms and Bet1 proteins via de novo synthesis of their mRNA transcripts. Knockdown of Syx5 during apoptosis or ER stress induction enhanced vulnerability of neurons. Additionally, we examined the effects of Golgi stress on Syx5 expression and {$\beta$}APP processing. Golgi stress also induced upregulation of ER\textendash Golgi SNARE Syx5, and concomitantly, suppressed amyloid-{$\beta$} peptide secretion. These findings suggest that Syx5 is a potential stress responsive factor that participates in {$\beta$}APP processing and the survival pathways of neuronal cells.},

Syx5 interacted only with the full-length PS holoproteins and not with the naturally occurring N- or C-terminal fragments. The PS holoproteins co-immunoprecipitated with the mutant Syx5, which localized to the ER and Golgi compartments, despite the substitution of the transmembrane region with that of syntaxin 1A. In contrast, the transmembrane deletion mutant that localized to the cytosol, but not to the ER or Golgi compartments, did not co-immunoprecipitate the PS holoproteins. The PS1 variant linked to familial Alzheimer's disease (PS1{$\Delta$}E9), lacking the region that contains the endoproteolytic cleavage site in the cytoplasmic loop, showed markedly decreased binding to Syx5. Immunofluorescence and sucrose-density-gradient fractionation analyses showed that the full-length PS holoproteins co-localized with Syx5 to the ER and cis-Golgi compartments. Furthermore, Syx5 overexpression resulted in the accumulation of PS holoproteins and the {$\beta$}-amyloid precursor protein, and reduced the secretion of the A{$\beta$} (amyloid {$\beta$}) peptide in COS-7~cells. In summary, these results indicate that Syx5 binds to full-length PSs and affects the processing and trafficking of {$\beta$}-amyloid precursor protein in the early secretory compartments.},

Among familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD)-linked PS mutants, PS1{$\Delta$}E9, which lacks the endoproteolytic cleavage site, showed markedly decreased binding to Syx 5. The interaction domains in Syx 5 were mapped to the transmembrane region and to the cytoplasmic region containing the {$\alpha$}-helical domains, which are distinct from the H3 (SNARE motif). Among all of the Syxs examined, only overexpression of Syx 5 resulted in the accumulation of {$\beta$}APP in the ER to cis-Golgi compartment, an attenuation of the amount of the C-terminal fragment (APP-CTF) of {$\beta$}APP, and a reduction in the secretion of A{$\beta$} peptides. Furthermore, co-expression of Syx 5 with C99 resulted in an increase in APP-CTF and suppressed A{$\beta$} secretion.

Treatment of cells that overexpressed Syx5L with brefeldin A, an inhibitor of transport from the ER to the Golgi compartments, resulted in substantial accumulation of intracellular {$\beta$}APP holoprotein and reduction in the secretion of A{$\beta$}.

Here, we discovered that transmembrane secretory cargos, such as interleukin 2 receptor {$\alpha$} subunit or Tac, transferrin receptor, and cluster of differentiation 8a, unexpectedly displayed substantial Golgi localization when their O-glycosylation was compromised. By quantitatively measuring their Golgi residence times, we found that the observed Golgi localization of O-glycan\textendash deficient cargos is due to their slow Golgi export. Using a superresolution microscopy method that we previously developed, we revealed that O-glycan\textendash deficient Tac chimeras localize at the interior of the trans-Golgi cisternae. O-Glycans were observed to be both necessary and sufficient for the efficient Golgi export of Tac chimeras. By sequentially introducing O-glycosylation sites to ST6GAL1, we demonstrated that O-glycan's effect on Golgi export is probably additive. Finally, the finding that N-glycosylated GFP substantially reduces the Golgi residence time of a Tac chimera suggests that N-glycans might have a similar effect. Therefore, both O- and N-glycans might function as a generic Golgi export signal at the trans-Golgi to promote the constitutive exocytic trafficking.},

We modified the mouse Tcirg1 locus encoding subunit a3, to express an a3-GFP fusion protein. Live-cell imaging and immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that nascent phagosomes received the a3-GFP from tubular structures extending from lysosomes located in the perinuclear region.

Because syntaxin 5, GS28, Ykt6, and GS15 exist as a unique SNARE complex, our observation indicates that these four SNAREs function as a complex in EE/RE-TGN transport. The importance of GS15 in EE/RE-TGN transport was further demonstrated by a block in recombinant STxB transport in HeLa cells when GS15 expression was knocked down by its small interfering iRNA. Morphological analyses showed that some GS15 and Ykt6 were redistributed from the Golgi to the endosomes when the recycling endosome was perturbed by SNX3-overexpression, suggesting that GS15 and Ykt6 might cycle between the endosomes and the Golgi apparatus. Further studies indicated that syntaxin 5 and syntaxin 16 exerted their role in EE/RE-TGN transport in an additive manner. The kinetics of inhibition exhibited by syntaxin 16 and syntaxin 5 antibodies is similar.},

  abstract = {The Golgi stress response is a homeostatic mechanism that controls the capacity of the Golgi apparatus in accordance with cellular demands. When the capacity of the Golgi apparatus becomes insufficient (Golgi stress), transcription levels of Golgi-related genes encoding glycosylation enzymes, a Golgi structural protein, and components of vesicular transport are upregulated through a common cis-acting enhancer\textemdash the Golgi apparatus stress response element (GASE). Here, we identified the transcription factor MLX as a GASE-binding protein. MLX resides in the cytoplasm and does not bind to GASE in normal growth conditions, whereas MLX translocates into the nucleus and specifically binds to GASE in response to Golgi stress. Suppression of MLX expression increased transcriptional induction of target genes of the Golgi stress response, whereas overexpression of MLX reduced GASE-binding of TFE3 as well as transcriptional induction from GASE, suggesting that MLX is a transcriptional repressor of the mammalian Golgi stress response.},

  abstract = {The Golgi stress response is a mechanism by which, under conditions of insufficient Golgi function (Golgi stress), the transcription of Golgi-related genes is upregulated through an enhancer, the Golgi apparatus stress response element (GASE), in order to maintain homeostasis in the Golgi. The molecular mechanisms associated with GASE remain to be clarified. Here, we identified TFE3 as a GASE-binding transcription factor. TFE3 was phosphorylated and retained in the cytoplasm in normal growth conditions, whereas it was dephosphorylated, translocated to the nucleus and activated Golgi-related genes through GASE under conditions of Golgi stress, e.g. in response to inhibition of oligosaccharide processing in the Golgi apparatus. From these observations, we concluded that the TFE3-GASE pathway is one of the regulatory pathways of the mammalian Golgi stress response, which regulates the expression of glycosylation-related proteins in response to insufficiency of glycosylation in the Golgi apparatus.},

  abstract = {Toxicity of human {$\alpha$}-synuclein when expressed in simple organisms can be suppressed by overexpression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-to-Golgi transport machinery, suggesting that inhibition of constitutive secretion represents a fundamental cause of the toxicity. Whether similar inhibition in mammals represents a cause of familial Parkinson's disease has not been established. We tested elements of this hypothesis by expressing human {$\alpha$}-synuclein in mammalian kidney and neuroendocrine cells and assessing ER-to-Golgi transport. Overexpression of wild type or the familial disease-associated A53T mutant {$\alpha$}-synuclein delayed transport by up to 50\%; however, A53T inhibited more potently. The secretory delay occurred at low expression levels and was not accompanied by insoluble {$\alpha$}-synuclein aggregates or mistargeting of transport machinery, suggesting a direct action of soluble {$\alpha$}-synuclein on trafficking proteins. Co-overexpression of ER/Golgi arginine soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (R-SNAREs) specifically rescued transport, indicating that {$\alpha$}-synuclein antagonizes SNARE function. Ykt6 reversed {$\alpha$}-synuclein inhibition much more effectively than sec22b, suggesting a possible neuroprotective role for the enigmatic high expression of ykt6 in neurons. In in vitro reconstitutions, purified {$\alpha$}-synuclein A53T protein specifically inhibited COPII vesicle docking and fusion at a pre-Golgi step. Finally, soluble {$\alpha$}-synuclein A53T directly bound ER/Golgi SNAREs and inhibited SNARE complex assembly, providing a potential mechanism for toxic effects in the early secretory pathway.},

We developed a quantitative sub-Golgi localization method based on centers of fluorescence masses of nocodazole-induced Golgi ministacks under conventional optical microscopy. Our method is rapid, convenient, and quantitative, and it yields a practical localization resolution of {$\sim$}30 nm. The method was validated by the previous electron microscopy data. We quantitatively studied the intra-Golgi trafficking of synchronized secretory membrane cargoes and directly demonstrated the cisternal progression of cargoes from the cis- to the trans-Golgi. Our data suggest that the constitutive efflux of secretory cargoes could be restricted at the Golgi stack, and the entry of the trans-Golgi network in secretory pathway could be signal dependent.},

Studying such spatial organization by optical imaging is challenging, partially due to the dense packing of stochastically oriented Golgi stacks. Using super-resolution microscopy and markers such as Giantin, we developed a method to identify en face and side views of individual nocodazole-induced Golgi mini-stacks. Our imaging uncovered that Golgi enzymes preferentially localize to the cisternal interior, appearing as a central disk or inner-ring, whereas components of the trafficking machinery reside at the periphery of the stack, including the cisternal rim. Interestingly, conventional secretory cargos appeared at the cisternal interior during their intra-Golgi trafficking and transiently localized to the cisternal rim before exiting the Golgi. In contrast, bulky cargos were found only at the rim. Our study therefore directly demonstrates the spatial separation of processing and transport functions within the Golgi complex.},

  abstract = {Congenital disorders of glycosylation type I (CDG-I) form a growing group of recessive neurometabolic diseases. Identification of disease genes is compromised by the enormous heterogeneity in clinical symptoms and the large number of potential genes involved. Until now, gene identification included the sequential application of biochemical methods in blood samples and fibroblasts. In genetically unsolved cases, homozygosity mapping has been applied in consanguineous families. Altogether, this time-consuming diagnostic strategy led to the identification of defects in 17 different CDG-I genes. Here, we applied whole-exome sequencing (WES) in combination with the knowledge of the protein N-glycosylation pathway for gene identification in our remaining group of six unsolved CDG-I patients from unrelated non-consanguineous families. Exome variants were prioritized based on a list of 76 potential CDG-I candidate genes, leading to the rapid identification of one known and two novel CDG-I gene defects. These included the first X-linked CDG-I due to a de novo mutation in ALG13, and compound heterozygous mutations in DPAGT1, together the first two steps in dolichol-PP-glycan assembly, and mutations in PGM1 in two cases, involved in nucleotide sugar biosynthesis. The pathogenicity of the mutations was confirmed by showing the deficient activity of the corresponding enzymes in patient fibroblasts. Combined with these results, the gene defect has been identified in 98\% of our CDG-I patients. Our results implicate the potential of WES to unravel disease genes in the CDG-I in newly diagnosed singleton families.},

Local extracellular acidification is carried out by vacuolar type H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) localized in the plasma membrane. We have shown that a3, one of the four subunit a isoforms (a1, a2, a3, and a4), is a component of the plasma membrane V-ATPase (Toyomura, T., Oka, T., Yamaguchi, C., Wada, Y., and Futai, M. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 8760\textendash 8765). To establish the unique localization of V-ATPase, we have used a murine macrophage cell line, RAW 264.7, that can differentiate into multinuclear osteoclast-like cells on stimulation with RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor {$\kappa$}B ligand). The V-ATPase with the a3 isoform was localized to late endosomes and lysosomes, whereas those with the a1 and a2 isoforms were localized to organelles other than lysosomes. After stimulation, the V-ATPase with the a3 isoform was immunochemically colocalized with lysosome marker lamp2 and was detected in acidic organelles. These organelles were also colocalized with microtubules, and the signals of lamp2 and a3 were dispersed by nocodazole, a microtubule depolymerizer. In RAW-derived osteoclasts cultured on mouse skull pieces, the a3 isoform was transported to the plasma membrane facing the bone and accumulated inside podosome rings. These findings indicate that V-ATPases with the a3 isoform localized in late endosomes/lysosomes are transported to the cell periphery during differentiation and finally assembled into the plasma membrane of mature osteoclasts.},

We describe in vitro binding experiments in which we identify ternary and quaternary Sed5p-containing SNARE complexes. The formation of SNARE complexes among these endoplasmic reticulum- and Golgi-localized proteins requires Sed5p and is syntaxin-selective. In addition, Sed5p-containing SNARE complexes form selectively and this selectivity is mediated by Sed5p-containing intermediates that discriminate among subsequent binding partners. Although many of these SNAREs have overlapping distributions in vivo, the SNAREs that form complexes with Sed5p in vitro reflect their functionally distinct locales. Although SNARE\textendash SNARE interactions are promiscuous and a single SNARE protein is often found in more than one complex, both the biochemical as well as genetic analyses reported here suggest that this is not a result of nonselective direct substitution of one SNARE for another. Rather our data are consistent with the existence of multiple (perhaps parallel) trafficking pathways where Sed5p-containing SNARE complexes play overlapping and/or distinct functional roles.},

At mitosis their architectures disappear and are reassembled in daughter cells. p97, an AAA-ATPase, mediates membrane fusion and is required for reassembly of these organelles. In the p97-mediated membrane fusion, p47 was identified as an essential cofactor, through which p97 binds to a SNARE, syntaxin5. A second essential cofactor, VCIP135, was identified as a p97/p47/syntaxin5-interacting protein. Several lines of recent evidence suggest that ubiquitination may be implicated in the p97/p47 pathway; p47 binds to monoubiquitinated proteins and VCIP135 shows a deubiquitinating activity in vitro. For the cell-cycle regulation of the p97/p47 pathway, it has been reported that the localization and phosphorylation-dephosphorylation of p47 are crucial. In this review, we describe the components involved in the p97-mediated membrane fusion and discuss the regulation of the fusion pathway.},

Many traditional methods provide information at population level and thus the average values of the studied cell physiological phenomena, excluding the fact that cell cultures are very heterogeneous. Single-cell analysis, on the other hand, offers more detailed insight into population variability, thereby facilitating a considerably deeper understanding of cell physiology. Although microscopy methods can address this issue, they suffer from limitations in terms of the small number of individual cells that can be studied and complicated image processing. We developed a noninvasive high-throughput method that employs flow cytometry to analyze large populations of cells that express pHluorin, a genetically encoded ratiometric fluorescent probe that is sensitive to pH. The method described here enables measurement of the intracellular pH of single cells with high sensitivity and speed, which is a clear improvement compared to previously published methods that either require pretreatment of the cells, measure cell populations, or require complex data analysis. The ratios of fluorescence intensities, which correlate to the intracellular pH, are independent of the expression levels of the pH probe, making the use of transiently or extrachromosomally expressed probes possible. We conducted an experiment on the kinetics of the pH homeostasis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cultures grown to a stationary phase after ethanol or glucose addition and after exposure to weak acid stress and glucose pulse. Minor populations with pH homeostasis behaving differently upon treatments were identified.},

The primary sequences around these modified residues do not adhere to the N-linked consensus sequon, NX(S/T).

  abstract = {Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor proteins (SNAREs) are essential components of the yeast protein-trafficking machinery and are required at the majority of membrane fusion events in the cell, where they facilitate SNARE-mediated fusion between the protein transport vesicles, the various membrane-enclosed organelles and, ultimately, the plasma membrane. We have demonstrated an increase in secretory titers for the Talaromyces emersonii Cel7A (Te-Cel7A, a cellobiohydrolase) and the Saccharomycopsis fibuligera Cel3A (Sf-Cel3A, a {$\beta$}-glucosidase) expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae through single and co-overexpression of some of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-to-Golgi SNAREs (BOS1, BET1, SEC22 and SED5). Overexpression of SED5 yielded the biggest improvements for both of the cellulolytic reporter proteins tested, with maximum increases in extracellular enzyme activity of 22~\% for the Sf-Cel3A and 68~\% for the Te-Cel7A. Co-overexpression of the ER-to-Golgi SNAREs yielded proportionately smaller increases for the Te-Cel7A (46~\%), with the Sf-Cel3A yielding no improvement. Co-overexpression of the most promising exocytic SNARE components identified in literature for secretory enhancement of the cellulolytic proteins tested (SSO1 for Sf-Cel3A and SNC1 for Te-Cel7A) with the most effective ER-to-Golgi SNARE components identified in this study (SED5 for both Sf-Cel3A and Te-Cel7A) yielded variable results, with Sf-Cel3A improved by 131~\% and Te-Cel7A yielding no improvement. Improvements were largely independent of gene dosage as all strains only integrated single additional SNARE gene copies, with episomal variance between the most improved strains shown to be insignificant. This study has added further credence to the notion that SNARE proteins fulfil an essential role within a larger cascade of secretory machinery components that could contribute significantly to future improvements to S. cerevisiae as protein production host.},

In mammals, V-ATPase subunit isoforms are differentially targeted to various intracellular compartments or tissues, but how these subunit isoforms influence enzyme activity is not clear. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, isoform diversity is limited to two different versions of the proton-translocating subunit a: Vph1p, which is targeted to the vacuole, and Stv1p, which is targeted to the Golgi apparatus and endosomes. We show that purified V-ATPase complexes containing Vph1p have higher ATPase activity than complexes containing Stv1p and that the relative difference in activity depends on the presence of lipids. We also show that VO complexes containing Stv1p could be readily purified without attached V1 regions. We used this effect to determine structures of the membrane-embedded VO region with Stv1p at 3.1-\AA{} resolution, which we compare with a structure of the VO region with Vph1p that we determine to 3.2-\AA{} resolution. These maps reveal differences in the surface charge near the cytoplasmic proton half-channel. Both maps also show the presence of bound lipids, as well as regularly spaced densities that may correspond to ergosterol or bound detergent, around the c-ring.},

We developed a novel F\"orster resonance energy transfer-fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FRET-FLIM)-based technique allowing visualization of real-time local interactions of fluorescently tagged SNARE proteins in live cells. We used FRET-FLIM to delineate the trafficking steps underlying the release of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) from human blood-derived dendritic cells. We found that activation of dendritic cells by bacterial lipopolysaccharide leads to increased FRET of fluorescently labeled syntaxin 4 with VAMP3 specifically at the plasma membrane, indicating increased SNARE complex formation, whereas FRET with other tested SNAREs was unaltered. Our results revealed that SNARE complexing is a key regulatory step for cytokine production by immune cells and prove the applicability of FRET-FLIM for visualizing SNARE complexes in live cells with subcellular spatial resolution.},

This result has been taken to indicate that Golgi-resident enzymes cycle to the ER constitutively. We show that ST-FRB is trapped in the ER even without Ii-FKBP upon rapamycin addition. This is because ER-Golgi-cycling FKBP proteins contain a C-terminal KDEL-like sequence, bind ST-FRB in the Golgi, and are transported together back to the ER by KDEL receptor-mediated retrograde transport. Moreover, depletion of KDEL receptor prevents trapping of ST-FRB in the ER by rapamycin. Thus ST-FRB cycles artificially by binding to FKBP domain-containing proteins. In addition, Golgi-specific O-linked glycosylation of a resident ER protein occurs only upon artificial fusion of Golgi membranes with ER. Together these findings support the consensus view that there is no appreciable mixing of Golgi-resident enzymes with ER under normal conditions.},

We have utilized quantitative immunogold labeling to establish the cis-trans distribution of the v-SNARE GS15 and the t-SNARE subunits GOS28 and syntaxin 5. Whereas the distribution of the t-SNARE is nearly even across the Golgi stack from the cis to the trans side, the v-SNARE GS15 is present in a gradient of increasing concentration toward the trans face of the stack. This contrasts with a second distinct SNARE complex, also required for intra-Golgi transport, consisting of syntaxin 5 (Sed5)-membrin (Bos1)-ERS24 (Sec22)-rBet1 (Bet1), whose v-(rBet1) and t-SNARE subunits (membrin and ERS24), progressively decrease in concentration toward the trans face. Transport within the stack therefore appears to utilize countercurrent gradients of two Golgi SNAREpins and may involve a mechanism akin to homotypic fusion.},

In addition, we investigated the effect of Stx5 on VLDL-R maturation, trafficking and processing. Here, we demonstrated mutual association of both proteins using several in vitro approaches. Furthermore, we detected a special maturation phenotype of VLDL-R resulting from Stx5 overexpression. We found that Stx5 prevented advanced Golgi-maturation of VLDL-R, but did not cause accumulation of the immature protein in ER, ER to Golgi compartments, or cis-Golgi ribbon, the main expression sites of Stx5. Rather more, abundantly present Stx5 was capable of translocating ER-/N-glycosylated VLDL-R to the plasma membrane, and thus was insensitive to BFA treatment and low temperature. Furthermore, abundant presence of Stx5 significantly interfered with VLDL-R reaching the trans-Golgi network. Based on our findings, we postulate that Stx5 can directly bind to the C-terminal domain of VLDL-R, thereby influencing the receptor{${'}$}s glycosylation, trafficking and processing characteristics.

Despite extensive study, the mechanism of action of p115 is poorly understood. SNARE proteins make up the machinery for membrane fusion, and strong evidence shows that function of p115 is directly linked to its interaction with SNAREs. Using a gel filtration binding assay, we have demonstrated that in solution p115 stably interacts with ER/Golgi SNAREs rbet1 and sec22b, but not membrin and syntaxin 5. These binding preferences stemmed from selectivity of p115 for monomeric SNARE motifs as opposed to SNARE oligomers. Soluble monomeric rbet1 can compete off p115 from coat protein II (COPII) vesicles. Furthermore, excess p115 inhibits p115 function in trafficking. We conclude that monomeric SNAREs are a major binding site for p115 on COPII vesicles, and that p115 dissociates from its SNARE partners upon SNAREpin assembly. Our results suggest a model in which p115 forms a mixed p115/SNARE helix bundle with a monomeric SNARE, facilitates the binding activity and/or concentration of the SNARE at prefusion sites and is subsequently ejected as SNARE complex formation and fusion proceed.},

High-resolution structures reveal an archetypal selectivity filter (SF) conformation in which dehydrated K+ ions, but not Na+ ions, are perfectly coordinated. Using single-molecule FRET (smFRET), we show that the SF-forming loop (SF-loop) in KirBac1.1 transitions between constrained and dilated conformations as a function of ion concentration. The constrained conformation, essential for selective K+ permeability, is stabilized by K+ but not Na+ ions. Mutations that render channels nonselective result in dilated and dynamically unstable conformations, independent of the permeant ion. Further, while wild-type KirBac1.1 channels are K+ selective in physiological conditions, Na+ permeates in the absence of K+. Moreover, whereas K+ gradients preferentially support 86Rb+ fluxes, Na+ gradients preferentially support 22Na+ fluxes. This suggests differential ion selectivity in constrained versus dilated states, potentially providing a structural basis for this anomalous mole fraction effect.},

Accumulated evidence has indicated that the Aequorea GFP is a relatively inflexible protein. Present evidence, however, indicates that the chromophore environment is readily accessible to a variety of external perturbants. Native Aequorea GFP has an absorbance maximum at 395 nm and a shoulder at 470 nm. In low ionic strength buffer at neutral pH and room temperature the 395/470 nm absorbance ratio is about 2.0. We show that this ratio is highly variable depending upon temperature, ionic strength, protein concentration, and pH. A maximum ratio of 6.5 (at a protein concentration of 18.6 mg/m/) and minimum of 0.42 (at a pH of 12.2) have been measured. In the latter case, the resulting absorption and excitation spectra resemble those of Renilla GFP in spectral shape (but not wavelength maximum). In all cases as the perturbant is varied the resulting spectra pass through a sharp isosbestic point, suggesting a relatively simple two-state mechanism. These spectral perturbations are fully reversible. On the basis of these results, we suggest that the chromophore binding site is conformationally flexible. pH-Dependent changes in the near-UV and visible circular dichroism spectra plus spectrophotometric titration of tyrosine residues lend additional support to this hypothesis.},

  abstract = {Fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) is widely applied to obtain quantitative information from fluorescence signals, particularly using F\"orster Resonant Energy Transfer (FRET) measurements to map, for example, protein-protein interactions. Extracting FRET efficiencies or population fractions typically entails fitting data to complex fluorescence decay models but such experiments are frequently photon constrained, particularly for live cell or in vivo imaging, and this leads to unacceptable errors when analysing data on a pixel-wise basis. Lifetimes and population fractions may, however, be more robustly extracted using global analysis to simultaneously fit the fluorescence decay data of all pixels in an image or dataset to a multi-exponential model under the assumption that the lifetime components are invariant across the image (dataset). This approach is often considered to be prohibitively slow and/or computationally expensive but we present here a computationally efficient global analysis algorithm for the analysis of time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) or time-gated FLIM data based on variable projection. It makes efficient use of both computer processor and memory resources, requiring less than a minute to analyse time series and multiwell plate datasets with hundreds of FLIM images on standard personal computers. This lifetime analysis takes account of repetitive excitation, including fluorescence photons excited by earlier pulses contributing to the fit, and is able to accommodate time-varying backgrounds and instrument response functions. We demonstrate that this global approach allows us to readily fit time-resolved fluorescence data to complex models including a four-exponential model of a FRET system, for which the FRET efficiencies of the two species of a bi-exponential donor are linked, and polarisation-resolved lifetime data, where a fluorescence intensity and bi-exponential anisotropy decay model is applied to the analysis of live cell homo-FRET data. A software package implementing this algorithm, FLIMfit, is available under an open source licence through the Open Microscopy Environment.},

Association of ERp44 with its clients is regulated by pH-dependent mechanisms, but the molecular details are not fully understood. Here we report high-resolution crystal structures of human ERp44 at neutral and weakly acidic pH. These structures reveal key regions in the C-terminal tail (C tail) missing in the original crystal structure, including a regulatory histidine-rich region and a subsequent extended loop. The former region forms a short {$\alpha$}-helix ({$\alpha$}16), generating a histidine-clustered site (His cluster). At low pH, the three Trx-like domains of ERp44 (``a,'' ``b,'' and ``b{${'}$}'') undergo significant rearrangements, likely induced by protonation of His157 located at the interface between the a and b domains. The {$\alpha$}16-helix is partially unwound and the extended loop is disordered in weakly acidic conditions, probably due to electrostatic repulsion between the protonated histidines in the His cluster. Molecular dynamics simulations indicated that helix unwinding enhances the flexibility of the C tail, disrupting its normal hydrogen-bonding pattern. The observed pH-dependent conformational changes significantly enlarge the positively charged regions around the client-binding site of ERp44 at low pH. Mutational analyses showed that ERp44 forms mixed disulfides with specific cysteines residing on negatively charged loop regions of Ero1{$\alpha$}. We propose that the protonation states of the essential histidines regulate the ERp44\textendash client interaction by altering the C-tail dynamics and surface electrostatic potential of ERp44.},

Although GLUT-4 vesicle trafficking has been intensely studied, few have focused on the mechanism by which the SNAREs themselves localize to specific membrane compartments. We therefore set out to identify the molecular determinants for localizing several syntaxin isoforms, including syntaxins 3, 4, and 5, to their respective intracellular compartments (plasma membrane for syntaxins 3 and 4;cis-Golgi for syntaxin 5). Analysis of a series of deletion and chimeric syntaxin constructs revealed that the 17-amino acid transmembrane domain of syntaxin 5 was sufficient to direct thecis-Golgi localization of several heterologous reporter constructs. In contrast, the longer 25-amino acid transmembrane domain of syntaxin 3 was sufficient to localize reporter constructs to the plasma membrane. Furthermore, truncation of the syntaxin 3 transmembrane domain to 17 amino acids resulted in a complete conversion to cis-Golgi compartmentalization that was indistinguishable from syntaxin 5. These data support a model wherein short transmembrane domains ({$\leq$}17 amino acids) direct thecis-Golgi localization of syntaxins, whereas long transmembrane domains ({$\geq$}23 amino acids) direct plasma membrane localization.},

By using a sensitive computer method, the generalized profile method, we were able to identify a new homology domain that is common in the two protein families previously identified to act as t-SNAREs, the syntaxin and SNAP-25 (synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kDa) families, which therefore constitute a new superfamily. This homology domain of approximately 60 amino acids is predicted to form a coiled-coil structure. The significance of this homology domain could be demonstrated by a partial suppression of the coiled-coil properties of the domain profile. In proteins belonging to the syntaxin family, a single homology domain is located near the transmembrane domain, whereas the members of the SNAP-25 family possess two homology domains. This domain was also identified in several proteins that have been implicated in vesicular transport but do not belong to any of the t-SNARE protein families. Several new yeast, nematode, and mammalian proteins were identified that belong to the new superfamily. The evolutionary conservation of the SNARE coiled-coil homology domain suggests that this domain has a similar function in different membrane fusion proteins.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Here, we show that the presumed phosphorylation of a conserved membrane-proximal PKA consensus site (serine-317) in the Sed5 t-SNARE regulates endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi transport, as well as Golgi morphology. Sed5 is a phosphoprotein, and both alanine and aspartate substitutions in serine-317 directly affect intracellular protein trafficking. The aspartate substitution results in elaboration of the ER, defects in Golgi-ER retrograde transport, an accumulation of small transport vesicles, and the inhibition of growth of most cell types. In contrast, the alanine substitution has no deleterious effects upon transport and growth, but results in ordering of the Golgi into a structure reminiscent of mammalian apparatus. This structure seems to require the recycling of Sed5, because it was found not to occur in sec21-2 cells that are defective in retrograde transport. Thus, a cycle of Sed5 phosphorylation and dephosphorylation is required for normal t-SNARE function and may choreograph Golgi ordering and dispersal.},

The cytosolic tail, TMD, and stem together make what is termed the CTS domain which is responsible for the specific localisation of these enzymes within sub-Golgi compartments via multiple mechanisms. In addition, the catalytic domains of some Golgi enzymes are secreted as a consequence of proteolytic cleavage within their TMDs or stem regions.

  abstract = {Skip to Next Section Erv41p and Erv46p are integral membrane proteins conserved across species. They were originally identified as abundant constituents of COPII-coated vesicles, and form a complex which cycles between the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex. Yeast strains lacking these proteins are viable but display subtle secretory phenotypes. In order to obtain information about possible biological roles of this protein complex in endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi transport, we employed the Synthetic Genetic Array approach to screen for synthetic genetic interactions with the erv46 null mutation. We identified synthetic interactions with vma12, vma21, vma22 and vps1 deletion mutations. The vma21{$\Delta$} mutation exacerbates transport defects caused by the erv46{$\Delta$} mutation. Unexpectedly, yeast strains lacking Vma21p fail to sort the endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi v-SNARE, Bos1p, efficiently into COPII vesicles, yet these vesicles are fully fusion competent. In addition, we set out to identify, by a biochemical approach, proteins interacting with the Erv41p-Erv46p complex. We report a strong interaction between the Erv41p-Erv46p complex and endoplasmic reticulum glucosidase II. Strains lacking a cycling Erv41p-Erv46p complex display a mild glycoprotein processing defect.},

  abstract = {While most SNAREs are permanently anchored to membranes by their transmembrane domains, the dually lipidated SNARE Ykt6 is found both on intracellular membranes and in the cytosol. The cytosolic Ykt6 is inactive due to the autoinhibition of the SNARE core by its longin domain, although the molecular basis of this inhibition is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that unlipidated Ykt6 adopts multiple conformations, with a small population in the closed state. The structure of Ykt6 in complex with a fatty acid suggests that, upon farnesylation, the Ykt6 SNARE core forms four {$\alpha$} helices that wrap around the longin domain, forming a dominantly closed conformation. The fatty acid, buried in~a hydrophobic groove formed between the longin domain and its SNARE core, is essential for maintaining the autoinhibited conformation of Ykt6. Our study reveals that the posttranslationally attached farnesyl group can actively regulate Ykt6 fusion activity in addition to its anticipated membrane-anchoring role.},

While the basic principles of the COPII machinery have been identified, it remains largely unknown how COPII transport is regulated to accommodate tissue- or activation-specific differences in cargo load and identity. Here we show that activation-induced alternative splicing of Sec16 controls adaptation of COPII transport to increased secretory cargo upon T-cell activation. Using splice-site blocking morpholinos and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome engineering, we show that the number of ER exit sites, COPII dynamics and transport efficiency depend on Sec16 alternative splicing. As the mechanistic basis, we suggest the C-terminal Sec16 domain to be a splicing-controlled protein interaction platform, with individual isoforms showing differential abilities to recruit COPII components. Our work connects the COPII pathway with alternative splicing, adding a new regulatory layer to protein secretion and its adaptation to changing cellular environments.},

  abstract = {Background Congenital disorders of glycosylation are caused by defects in the glycosylation of proteins and lipids. Classically, gene defects with multisystem disease have been identified in the ubiquitously expressed glycosyltransferases required for protein N-glycosylation. An increasing number of defects are being described in sugar supply pathways for protein glycosylation with tissue-restricted clinical symptoms. Scope of review In this review, we address the hexosamine and sialic acid biosynthesis pathways in sugar metabolism. GFPT1, PGM3 and GNE are essential for synthesis of nucleotide sugars uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) and cytidine-5{${'}$}-monophospho-N-acetylneuraminic acid (CMP-sialic acid) as precursors for various glycosylation pathways. Defects in these enzymes result in contrasting clinical phenotypes of congenital myasthenia, immunodeficiency or adult-onset myopathy, respectively. We therefore discuss the biochemical mechanisms of known genetic defects in the hexosamine and CMP-sialic acid synthesis pathway in relation to the clinical phenotypes. Major conclusions Both UDP-GlcNAc and CMP-sialic acid are important precursors for diverse protein glycosylation reactions and for conversion into other nucleotide-sugars. Defects in the synthesis of these nucleotide sugars might affect a wide range of protein glycosylation reactions. Involvement of multiple glycosylation pathways might contribute to disease phenotype, but the currently available biochemical information on sugar metabolism is insufficient to understand why defects in these pathways present with tissue-specific phenotypes. General significance Future research on the interplay between sugar metabolism and different glycosylation pathways in a tissue- and cell-specific manner will contribute to elucidation of disease mechanisms and will create new opportunities for therapeutic intervention.

Popular models of SM protein function hold that these proteins promote or maintain an open and/or monomeric pool of syntaxin molecules available for SNARE complex formation. To address the functional relationship of the mammalian endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi SM protein rsly1 and its SNARE binding partner syntaxin 5, we produced a conformation-specific monoclonal antibody that binds only the available, but not the cis-SNARE\textendash complexed nor intramolecularly closed form of syntaxin 5. Immunostaining experiments demonstrated that syntaxin 5 SNARE motif availability is nonuniformly distributed and focally regulated. In vitro endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi transport assays revealed that rsly1 was acutely required for transport, and that binding to syntaxin 5 was absolutely required for its function. Finally, manipulation of rsly1\textendash syntaxin 5 interactions in vivo revealed that they had remarkably little impact on the pool of available syntaxin 5 SNARE motif. Our results argue that although rsly1 does not seem to regulate the availability of syntaxin 5, its function is intimately associated with syntaxin binding, perhaps promoting a later step in SNARE complex formation or function.},

Golgins are present in all eukaryotes, suggesting an evolutionary conserved function. Golgins are anchored to the Golgi membrane by their carboxy terminus and are predicted to adopt an extended conformation that projects into the surrounding cytoplasm. This arrangement is ideal for the capture or tethering of nearby membranes or cytoskeletal elements. Golgin-mediated tethering is thought to be important for vesicular traffic at the Golgi apparatus, the maintenance of Golgi architecture, as well as the positioning of the Golgi apparatus within cells. In addition to acting as tethers, some golgins can also sequester various factors at the Golgi membrane, allowing for the spatiotemporal regulation of downstream cellular functions. Although it is now established that golgins are membrane and cytoskeleton tethers, the mechanisms underlying tethering remain poorly defined. Moreover, the importance of golgin-mediated tethering in a physiological context remains to be fully explored. This review will describe our current understanding of golgin function, highlighting recent progress that has been made, and goes on to discuss outstanding questions and potential avenues for future research with regard to this family of conserved Golgi-associated proteins.},

The important cytoprotective functions of autophagy are demonstrated by the diverse pathogenic consequences that may stem from autophagy dysregulation in a growing number of neurodegenerative disorders. In many of the diseases associated with autophagy anomalies, it is the final stage of autophagy\textendash lysosomal degradation that is disrupted. In several disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), defective lysosomal acidification contributes to this proteolytic failure. The complex regulation of lysosomal pH makes this process vulnerable to disruption by many factors, and reliable lysosomal pH measurements have become increasingly important in investigations of disease mechanisms. Although various reagents for pH quantification have been developed over several decades, they are not all equally well suited for measuring the pH of lysosomes. Here, we evaluate the most commonly used pH probes for sensitivity and localisation, and identify LysoSensor yellow/blue-dextran, among currently used probes, as having the optimal profile of properties for measuring lysosomal pH. In addition, we review evidence that lysosomal acidification is defective in AD and extend our original findings, of elevated lysosomal pH in presenilin 1 (PS1)-deficient blastocysts and neurons, to additional cell models of PS1 and PS1/2 deficiency, to fibroblasts from AD patients with PS1 mutations, and to neurons in the PS/APP mouse model of AD.},

  abstract = {The internal organization of cells depends on mechanisms to ensure that transport carriers, such as vesicles, fuse only with the correct destination organelle. Several types of proteins have been proposed to confer specificity to this process, and we have recently shown that a set of coiled-coil proteins on the Golgi, called golgins, are able to capture specific classes of carriers when relocated to an ectopic location. Mapping of six different golgins reveals that, in each case, a short 20\textendash 50 residue region is necessary and sufficient to capture specific carriers. In all six of GMAP-210, golgin-84, TMF, golgin-97, golgin-245, and GCC88, this region is located at the extreme N-terminus of the protein. The vesicle-capturing regions of GMAP-210, golgin-84, and TMF capture intra-Golgi vesicles and share some sequence features, suggesting that they act in a related, if distinct, manner. In the case of GMAP-210, this shared feature is in addition to a previously characterized ``amphipathic lipid-packing sensor'' motif that can capture highly curved membranes, with the two motifs being apparently involved in capturing distinct types of vesicles. Of the three GRIP domain golgins that capture endosome-to-Golgi carriers, golgin-97 and golgin-245 share a closely related capture motif, whereas that in GCC88 is distinct, suggesting that it works by a different mechanism and raising the possibility that the three golgins capture different classes of endosome-derived carriers that share many cargos but have distinct features for recognition at the Golgi. For six different golgins, the capture of carriers is mediated by a short region at the N-terminus of the protein. There appear to be at least four different types of motif, consistent with specific golgins capturing specific classes of carrier and implying the existence of distinct receptors present on each of these different carrier classes.},

Only a minority of lipids achieve their final intracellular distribution through transport by vesicles. Instead, the bulk of lipid traffic is mediated by a large group of lipid transfer proteins (LTPs), which move small numbers of lipids at a time using hydrophobic cavities that stabilize lipid molecules outside membranes. Although the first LTPs were discovered almost 50 years ago, most progress in understanding these proteins has been made in the past few years, leading to considerable temporal and spatial refinement of our understanding of the function of these lipid transporters. The number of known LTPs has increased, with exciting discoveries of their multimeric assembly. Structural studies of LTPs have progressed from static crystal structures to dynamic structural approaches that show how conformational changes contribute to lipid handling at a sub-millisecond timescale. A major development has been the finding that many intracellular LTPs localize to two organelles at the same time, forming a shuttle, bridge or tube that links donor and acceptor compartments. The understanding of how different lipids achieve their final destination at the molecular level allows a better explanation of the range of defects that occur in diseases associated with lipid transport and distribution, opening up the possibility of developing therapies that specifically target lipid transfer.},

The mechanisms that permit cargo-loaded transport vesicles from different origins to selectively access different Golgi compartments are incompletely understood.

We find that subsets of golgins with distinct localizations on the Golgi surface have capture activities toward vesicles of different origins. These findings demonstrate that golgins act as tethers in vivo, and hence the specificity we find to be encoded in this tethering is likely to make a major contribution to the organization of membrane traffic at the Golgi apparatus.},

  abstract = {The subcellular localization, interacting partners, and function of GS15, a Golgi SNARE, remain to be established. In our present study, it is revealed that unlike proteins (Bet1 and the KDEL receptor) cycling between the Golgi and the intermediate compartment (IC, inclusive of the ER exit sites), GS15 is not redistributed into the IC upon incubation at 15\textdegree C or when cells are treated with brefeldin A. Immuno-electron microscopy (immuno-EM) reveals that GS15 is mainly found in the medial-cisternae of the Golgi apparatus and adjacent tubulo-vesicular elements. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments suggest that GS15 exists in a distinct SNARE complex that contains SNAREs (syntaxin5, GS28, and Ykt6) that are implicated in both ER-to-Golgi and intra-Golgi transport but not with SNAREs involved exclusively in ER-to-Golgi traffic. Furthermore, components of COPI coat can be selectively coimmunoprecipitated with GS15 from Golgi extracts. Overexpression of mutant forms of GS15 affects the normal distribution of cis- and medial-Golgi proteins (GS28, syntaxin 5, and Golgi mannosidase II), whereas proteins of the trans-Golgi and TGN (Vti1-rp2/Vti1a and syntaxin 6) and Golgi matrix/scaffold (GM130 and p115) are less affected. When the level of GS15 is reduced by duplex 21-nt small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown approach, diverse markers of the Golgi apparatus are redistributed into small dotty and diffuse labeling, suggesting an essential role of GS15 in the Golgi apparatus.},

Because only the exocytic SNARE complexes have been characterized in detail, the structural features shared by SNARE complexes from different fusion steps are not known. We now describe the subunit structure, assembly, and regulation of a quaternary SNARE complex, which appears to mediate an early step in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to Golgi transport. Purified recombinant syntaxin 5, membrin, and rbet1, three Q-SNAREs, assemble cooperatively to create a high affinity binding site for sec22b, an R-SNARE. The syntaxin 5 amino-terminal domain potently inhibits SNARE complex assembly. The ER/Golgi quaternary complex is remarkably similar to the synaptic complex, suggesting that a common pattern is followed at all transport steps, where three Q-helices assemble to form a high affinity binding site for a fourth R-helix on an opposing membrane. Interestingly, although sec22b binds to the combination of syntaxin 5, membrin, and rbet1, it can only bind if it is present while the others assemble; sec22b cannot bind to a pre-assembled ternary complex of syntaxin 5, membrin, and rbet1. Finally, we demonstrate that the quaternary complex containing sec22b is not an in vitro entity only, but is a bona fide species in living cells.},

Secretory cargo moves inward in membrane carriers for delivery to Golgi membranes in which it is processed and packaged for transport outward to the plasma membrane. Cytoplasmic dynein motor proteins (herein termed dynein) primarily mediate inward cargo carrier movement and Golgi positioning. These motors move along microtubules toward microtubule minus-ends embedded in centrosomes. Centripetal motility is controlled by a host of regulators whose precise functions remain to be determined. Significantly, a specific Golgi receptor for dynein has not been identified. This has impaired progress toward elucidation of membrane-motor-microtubule attachment in the periphery and, after inward movement, recycling of the motor for another round. Pericentrosomal positioning of the Golgi apparatus is dynamic. It is regulated during critical cellular processes such as mitosis, differentiation, cell polarization, and cell migration. Positioning is also important as it aligns the Golgi along an axis of cell polarity. In certain cell types, this promotes secretion directed to the proximal plasma membrane domain thereby maintaining specializations critical for diverse processes including wound healing, immunological synapse formation, and axon determination.},

The directly converted osteoblasts (dOBs) induced by RXOL displayed a similar gene expression profile as normal human osteoblasts and contributed to bone repair after transplantation into immunodeficient mice at artificial bone defect lesions. The dOBs expressed endogenous Runx2 and Osterix, and did not require continuous expression of the exogenous genes to maintain their phenotype. Another combination, Oct4 plus L-Myc (OL), also induced fibroblasts to produce bone matrix, but the OL-transduced cells did not express Osterix and exhibited a more distant gene expression profile to osteoblasts compared with RXOL-transduced cells. These findings strongly suggest successful direct reprogramming of fibroblasts into functional osteoblasts by RXOL, a technology that may provide bone regeneration therapy against bone disorders.},

Cells cultured with ALK5 i II expressed osteoblast-specific genes and massively produced calcified bone matrix, similar to the osteoblasts induced from mesenchymal stem cells (MSC-OBs). Treatment with vitamin D3 in addition to ALK5 i II induced more osteoblast-like characters, and the efficiency of the conversion reached approximately 90\%. The chemical compound-mediated directly converted osteoblasts (cOBs) were similar to human primary osteoblasts in terms of expression profiles of osteoblast-related genes. The cOBs abundantly produced bone matrix in vivo and facilitated bone healing after they were transplanted into immunodeficient mice at an artificially induced defect lesion in femoral bone. The present procedure realizes a highly efficient direct conversion of human fibroblasts into transgene-free and highly functional osteoblasts, which might be applied in a novel strategy of bone regeneration therapy in bone diseases.},

  abstract = {Proteins essential for vesicle formation by the Coat Protein I (COPI) complex are being identified, but less is known about the role of specific lipids. Brefeldin-A ADP-ribosylated substrate (BARS) functions in the fission step of COPI vesicle formation. Here, we show that BARS induces membrane curvature in cooperation with phosphatidic acid. This finding has allowed us to further delineate COPI vesicle fission into two sub-stages: 1) an earlier stage of bud-neck constriction, in which BARS and other COPI components are required, and 2) a later stage of bud-neck scission, in which phosphatidic acid generated by phospholipase D2 (PLD2) is also required. Moreover, in contrast to the disruption of the Golgi seen on perturbing the core COPI components (such as coatomer), inhibition of PLD2 causes milder disruptions, suggesting that such COPI components have additional roles in maintaining Golgi structure other than through COPI vesicle formation.},

  abstract = {Lysosomal trafficking and protease exocytosis in osteoclasts are essential for ruffled border formation and bone resorption. Yet the mechanism underlying lysosomal trafficking and the related process of exocytosis remains largely unknown. We found ATP6ap1 (Ac45), an accessory subunit of vacuolar-type H(+)-ATPases (V-ATPases), to be highly induced by receptor activator for nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) in osteoclast differentiation. Ac45 knockdown osteoclasts formed normal actin rings, but had severely impaired extracellular acidification and bone resorption. Ac45 knockdown significantly reduced osteoclast formation. The decrease in the number of osteoclasts does not result from abnormal apoptosis; rather, it results from decreased osteoclast precursor cell proliferation and fusion, which may be partially due to the downregulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation and FBJ osteosarcoma oncogene (c-fos), nuclear factor of activated T-cells, cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1), and "transmembrane 7 superfamily member 4" (Tm7sf4) expression. Notably, Ac45 knockdown osteoclasts exhibited impaired lysosomal trafficking and exocytosis, as indicated by the absence of lysosomal trafficking to the ruffled border and a lack of cathepsin K exocytosis into the resorption lacuna. Our data revealed that the impaired exocytosis is specifically due to Ac45 deficiency, and not the general consequence of a defective V-ATPase. Together, our results demonstrate the essential role of Ac45 in osteoclast-mediated extracellular acidification and protease exocytosis, as well as the ability of Ac45 to guide lysosomal intracellular trafficking to the ruffled border, potentially through its interaction with the small guanosine-5'-triphosphatase (GTPase) Rab7. Our work indicates that Ac45 may be a novel therapeutic target for osteolytic disease.},

  abstract = {Skip to Next Section Export out of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) involves the Sar1 and COPII machinery acting at ER exit sites (ERES). Whether and how cargo proteins are recruited upstream of Sar1 and COPII is unclear. Two models are conceivable, a recruitment model where cargo is actively transported through a transport factor and handed over to the Sar1 and COPII machinery in ERES, and a capture model, where cargo freely diffuses into ERES where it is captured by the Sar1 and COPII machinery. Using the novel secretion inhibitor FLI-06, we show that recruitment of the cargo VSVG to ERES is an active process upstream of Sar1 and COPII. Applying FLI-06 before concentration of VSVG in ERES completely abolishes its recruitment. In contrast, applying FLI-06 after VSVG concentration in ERES does not lead to dispersal of the concentrated VSVG, arguing that it inhibits recruitment to ERES as opposed to capture in ERES. FLI-06 also inhibits export out of the trans-Golgi network (TGN), suggesting that similar mechanisms might orchestrate cargo selection and concentration at the ER and TGN. FLI-06 does not inhibit autophagosome biogenesis and the ER-peroxisomal transport route, suggesting that these rely on different mechanisms.},

Previous studies of WLS trafficking have emphasized WLS movement from the Golgi to the plasma membrane (PM) and then back to the Golgi via retromer-mediated endocytic recycling. We find that endogenous WLS binds Wnts in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), cycles to the PM, and then returns to the ER through the Golgi. We identify an ER-targeting sequence at the carboxyl terminus of native WLS that is critical for ER retrograde recycling and contributes to Wnt secretory function. Golgi-to-ER recycling of WLS requires the COPI regulator ARF as well as ERGIC2, an ER-Golgi intermediate compartment protein that is also required for the retrograde trafficking of the KDEL receptor and certain toxins. ERGIC2 is required for efficient Wnt secretion. ER retrieval is an integral part of the WLS transport cycle.},

  abstract = {Ypt1 and Sec4 are essential Rab GTPases that control the early and late stages of the yeast secretory pathway, respectively. A chimera consisting of Ypt1 with the switch I domain of Sec4, Ypt1-SW1Sec4, is efficiently activated in vitro by the Sec4 exchange factor, Sec2. This should lead to its ectopic activation in vivo and thereby disrupt membrane traffic. Nonetheless early studies found that yeast expressing Ypt1-SW1Sec4 as the sole copy of YPT1 exhibit no growth defect. To resolve this conundrum, we have analyzed yeast expressing various levels of Ypt1-SW1Sec4. We show that even normal expression of Ypt1-SW1Sec4 leads to kinetic transport defects at a late stage of the pathway, with secretory vesicles accumulating near exocytic sites. Higher levels are toxic. Toxicity is suppressed by truncation of Uso1, a vesicle tether required for endoplasmic reticulum\textendash Golgi traffic. The globular head of Uso1 binds to Ypt1 and its coiled-coil tail binds to the Golgi-associated SNARE, Sed5. We propose that when Uso1 is inappropriately recruited to secretory vesicles by Ypt1-SW1Sec4, the extended coiled-coil tail blocks docking to the plasma membrane. This putative inhibitory function could serve to increase the fidelity of vesicle docking.},

In interphase, recycling occurred every 1.5 hr, and blocking ER egress trapped cycling Golgi enzymes in the ER with loss of Golgi structure. In mitosis, when ER export stops, Golgi proteins redistributed into the ER as shown by quantitative imaging in vivo and immuno-EM. Comparison of the mobilities of Golgi proteins and lipids ruled out the persistence of a separate mitotic Golgi vesicle population and supported the idea that all Golgi components are absorbed into the ER. Moreover, reassembly of the Golgi complex after mitosis failed to occur when ER export was blocked. These results demonstrate that in mitosis the Golgi disperses and reforms through the intermediary of the ER, exploiting constitutive recycling pathways. They thus define a novel paradigm for Golgi genesis and inheritance.},

  abstract = {The likelihood of an individual being able to recover from cancer depends on: where the cancer is within the body, how quickly the disease is detected and how quickly treatment is started. Cancers that have spread from their original location to another part of the body are particular challenging to treat, and cause the vast majority of cancer deaths every year. Treatments that can recognize and eradicate cancer cells, while leaving nearby healthy cells untouched, are still needed\textemdash and so there has been a lot of research into identifying the key differences between healthy cells and cancer cells. For several decades, researchers have been aware that cancer cells have more proteins coated with modified sugars on their cell surfaces than healthy cells. This is caused by the enzymes that add these sugars to the proteins relocating from one location within the cell, the Golgi apparatus, to another, called the endoplasmic reticulum. These specific `sugar-coated' proteins are known to encourage cancer cells to migrate and invade new tissues, but the mechanisms that regulate the addition of these sugar molecules to proteins remains poorly understood. Now Chia et al. have discovered 12 molecules that regulate this process, including an enzyme called ERK8 that is found at the Golgi apparatus. ERK8 is shown to prevent the relocation of the sugar-adding enzymes from the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum, thereby restricting the production of sugar-coated proteins that help the cancer cells to spread within the body. By identifying 12 potential targets for new therapeutics aimed at preventing the spread of cancer, the work of Chia et al. could ultimately help to improve the chances of patients recovering from certain cancers.},

METHODS: Expression of rat homologs of 33 genes from above region was determined in kidney tissues derived from rats of different fetal development ages (E13, E15, E19) and adulthood with reverse transcriptase-PCR. Potential mutation(s) in candidate gene SNAP29, whose expression pattern appeared to be unique, was screened in 44 patients and 220 normal controls with PCR-single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP). Suspected positive regions were sequenced to verify the mutations. RESULTS: Nine genes showed no expression throughout the whole development process; 18 genes with various expression levels showed continuous expression from the beginning of development; 6 genes only expressed for a short time, among which SNAP29 was selected for mutation screening. Upon sequencing, three mutations were identified from the 44 patients, including a G to A transition (GAG to AAG) in exon 2, and two A to G transitions (AGC to GGC) in exon 3. CONCLUSION: Through systematic analysis of the expression of genes from chromosomal region 22q11.2, the SNAP29 gene was found to have a potential role in the development of genitourinary system. Two missense mutations were identified in three patients. These included one in exon 2 (featuring cryptorchidism), and the other in exon 3 (featuring cryptorchidism and hypospadia). Neither of the mutations was found in the normal controls. The results suggested that mutation(s) of gene(s) from chromosomal region 22q11.2 may play an important role in the genesis of genitourinary malformations.},

A mammalian protein (rbet1) homologous to Bet1p was recently identified, and it was concluded that rbet1 is associated with the Golgi apparatus based on the subcellular localization of transiently expressed epitope-tagged rbet1. In the present study using rabbit antibodies raised against the cytoplasmic domain of rbet1, we found that the majority of rbet1 is not associated with the Golgi apparatus as marked by the Golgi mannosidase II in normal rat kidney cells. Rather, rbet1 is predominantly associated with vesicular spotty structures that concentrate in the peri-Golgi region but are also present throughout the cytoplasm. These structures colocalize with the KDEL receptor and ERGIC-53, which are known to be enriched in the intermediate compartment. When the Golgi apparatus is fragmented by nocodazole treatment, a significant portion of rbet1 is not colocalized with structures marked by Golgi mannosidase II or the KDEL receptor. Association of rbet1 in cytoplasmic spotty structures is apparently not altered by preincubation of cells at 15\textdegree C. However, upon warming up from 15 to 37\textdegree C, rbet1 concentrates into the peri-Golgi region. Furthermore, rbet1 colocalizes with vesicular stomatitis virus G-protein en route from the ER to the Golgi. Antibodies against rbet1 inhibit in vitro transport of G-protein from the ER to the Golgi apparatus in a dose-dependent manner. This inhibition can be neutralized by preincubation of antibodies with recombinant rbet1. EGTA is known to inhibit ER-Golgi transport at a stage after vesicle docking but before the actual fusion event. Antibodies against rbet1 inhibit ER-Golgi transport only when they are added before the EGTA-sensitive stage. These results suggest that rbet1 may be involved in the docking process of ER- derived vesicles with the cis-Golgi membrane.},

The functional role of its mammalian homologue (Ykt6) has not been established. Using antibodies specific for mammalian Ykt6, it is revealed that it is found mainly in Golgi-enriched membranes. Three SNAREs, syntaxin 5, GS28, and Bet1, are specifically associated with Ykt6 as revealed by co-immunoprecipitation, suggesting that these four SNAREs form a SNARE complex. Double labeling of Ykt6 and the Golgi marker mannosidase II or the ER-Golgi recycling marker KDEL receptor suggests that Ykt6 is primarily associated with the Golgi apparatus. Unlike the KDEL receptor, Ykt6 does not cycle back to the peripheral ER exit sites. Antibodies against Ykt6 inhibit in vitro ER-Golgi transport of vesicular stomatitis virus envelope glycoprotein (VSVG) only when they are added before the EGTA-sensitive stage. ER-Golgi transport of VSVG in vitro is also inhibited by recombinant Ykt6. In the presence of antibodies against Ykt6, VSVG accumulates in peri-Golgi vesicular structures and is prevented from entering the mannosidase II compartment, suggesting that Ykt6 functions at a late stage in ER-Golgi transport. Golgi apparatus marked by mannosidase II is fragmented into vesicular structures in cells microinjected with Ykt6 antibodies. It is concluded that Ykt6 functions in a late step of ER-Golgi transport, and this role may be important for the integrity of the Golgi complex.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a highly dynamic organelle that plays a critical role in many cellular processes. Abnormal ER morphology is associated with some human diseases, although little is known regarding how ER morphology is regulated. Using a forward genetic screen to identify genes that regulated ER morphology in \emph{Drosophila}, we identified a mutant of \emph{Sec22}, the orthologs of which in yeast, plants, and humans are required for ER to Golgi trafficking. However, the physiological function of Sec22 has not been previously investigated in animal development. A loss of \emph{Sec22} resulted in ER proliferation and expansion, enlargement of late endosomes, and abnormal Golgi morphology in mutant larvae fat body cells. However, starvation-induced autophagy was not affected by a loss of \emph{Sec22}. Mosaic analysis of the eye revealed that Sec22 was required for photoreceptor morphogenesis. In \emph{Sec22} mutant photoreceptor cells, the ER was highly expanded and gradually lost normal morphology with aging. The rhabdomeres in mutants were small and sometimes fused with each other. The morphology of \emph{Sec22} mutant eyes resembled the eye morphology of flies with overexpressed \emph{eyc} (\emph{eyes closed}). \emph{eyc} encodes for a \emph{Drosophila} p47 protein that is required for membrane fusion. A loss of \emph{Syntaxin5} (\emph{Syx5}), encoding for a t-SNARE on Golgi, also phenocopied the \emph{Sec22} mutant. Sec22 formed complexes with Syx5 and Eyc. Thus, we propose that appropriate trafficking between the ER and Golgi is required for maintaining ER morphology and for \emph{Drosophila} eye morphogenesis.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Not surprisingly, this organelle, a major compartment of the secretory pathway, is an important venue for regulating many aspects of development in both invertebrates and vertebrates. Through its role as a site for protein cleavage and glycosylation as well as through changes in its spatial organization and secretory trafficking, the Golgi exerts highly specific effects on cellular differentiation and morphogenesis by spatially and temporally constraining developmental pathways., Developmental pathways in invertebrates and vertebrates are controlled in part by specific protein modifications and trafficking events at the Golgi. However, different species and cell types use Golgi in different ways to influence development.},

  abstract = {The conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex is an evolutionarily conserved multi-subunit protein complex that regulates membrane trafficking in eukaryotic cells. In this work we used short interfering RNA strategy to achieve an efficient knockdown (KD) of Cog3p in HeLa cells. For the first time, we have demonstrated that Cog3p depletion is accompanied by reduction in Cog1, 2, and 4 protein levels and by accumulation of COG complex-dependent (CCD) vesicles carrying v-SNAREs GS15 and GS28 and cis-Golgi glycoprotein GPP130. Some of these CCD vesicles appeared to be vesicular coat complex I (COPI) coated. A prolonged block in CCD vesicles tethering is accompanied by extensive fragmentation of the Golgi ribbon. Fragmented Golgi membranes maintained their juxtanuclear localization, cisternal organization and are competent for the anterograde trafficking of vesicular stomatitis virus G protein to the plasma membrane. In a contrast, Cog3p KD resulted in inhibition of retrograde trafficking of the Shiga toxin. Furthermore, the mammalian COG complex physically interacts with GS28 and COPI and specifically binds to isolated CCD vesicles.},
