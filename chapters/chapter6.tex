\section{Abstract}

The SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) protein syntaxin-5 (Stx5) is essential for Golgi transport. In humans, the \emph{STX5} mRNA encodes two protein isoforms, Stx5 Long (Stx5L) from the first starting methionine and Stx5 Short (Stx5S) from an alternative starting methionine at position 55. In this study, we identified a novel human disorder caused by a single missense substitution in the second starting methionine (p.M55V), resulting in complete loss of the short isoform. Patients suffer from an early fatal multisystem disease, including severe liver disease, skeletal abnormalities and abnormal glycosylation. Primary human dermal fibroblasts isolated from these patients showed defective glycosylation, altered Golgi morphology as measured by electron microscopy and mislocalization of glycosyltransferases. Measurements of anterograde trafficking, based on biotin-synchronizable forms of Stx5 (the RUSH system), and of cognate binding SNAREs, based on Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET), revealed that the short isoform of Stx5 is essential for intra-Golgi transport. This is the first time a mutation in an alternative starting codon is linked to human disease, demonstrating that the site of translation initiation is an important new layer of regulating protein trafficking.

\section{Introduction}

In eukaryotes, proteins destined for the secretory pathway are synthesized at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and then transported to the Golgi apparatus, where they are sorted for their ultimate destinations at the \emph{trans}-Golgi network. Central to this process is intracellular membrane fusion, which is mediated by members of the SNARE (soluble \emph{N}-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) protein family. Cognate SNARE proteins that are present in both the carrier vesicle and target membranes, called v- and t-SNAREs respectively, engage and form a tight alpha-helical coiled-coil bundle that overcomes the energy barrier of membrane fusion. Membrane fusion requires a single R-SNARE, characterized by an arginine residue located central in the SNARE bundle, and three Q-SNAREs, with glutamine residues instead. Generally in mammalian cells, the R-SNAREs act as vesicle (v-) SNAREs and the Q-SNAREs together form the t-SNARE complex on the target membrane\cite{jahn_snares_2006}. In contrast, the Qc-SNAREs Bet1 and Bet1L (GS15) function as the v-SNAREs at the ER/Golgi interface\cite{banfield_snare-like_1995,parlati_topological_2000,parlati_distinct_2002,xu_gs15_2002}, while, for anterograde ER to Golgi trafficking, the recipient t-SNARE complex is formed by the Qa-SNARE syntaxin-5 (Stx5)\cite{bentley_snare_2006,dascher_syntaxin_1994,rowe_role_1998,xu_subunit_2000}, together with the Qb-SNAREs GosR1 (also known as GS27 or membrin) or GosR2 (GS28), and R-SNAREs Ykt6 or Sec22b (Ers24)\cite{hay_localization_1998,paek_ers-24_1997,zhang_ykt6_2001}. This different allocation of the Qc-SNAREs Bet1 and Bet1L as v-SNARE instead of t-SNARE possibly prevents the formation of non-functional SNARE complexes during ER to Golgi transit. In addition, Stx5 functions in retrograde intra-Golgi transport by forming a recipient t-SNARE complex with GosR1, and Ykt6\cite{xu_gs15_2002,linders_stx5-mediated_2019} and in retrograde trafficking from endosomes to the \emph{trans}-Golgi network (TGN)\cite{malsam_organization_2011,tai_participation_2004}, making it a unique SNARE protein involved in both anterograde and retrograde Golgi transport.

\emph{STX5} is highly conserved and is an essential gene in animals and fungi\cite{dickinson_high-throughput_2016,koscielny_international_2014}. In animals, Stx5 exists as a long and a short isoform translated from the same mRNA: 39.6 kDa sized Stx5 Long (Stx5L) and 34.1 kDa sized Stx5 Short (Stx5S)\cite{linders_stx5-mediated_2019,hui_isoform_1997}. This is in contrast to lower organisms such as \emph{Saccharomyces cerevisiae}, which only express a single isoform of Stx5 (Sed5p). Although Sed5p was originally believed to resemble mammalian Stx5S\cite{linders_stx5-mediated_2019}, it is now clear that it likely more resembles Stx5L, since an N-terminal COPI-binding tribasic motif has been identified in Sed5p\cite{gao_multiple_2020}. The emergence of a second Stx5 isoform can be traced back to the pacific purple sea urchin, \emph{Strongylocentrotus purpuratus}, and is also present in the model organism \emph{Danio rerio}, but not in \emph{Drosophila melanogaster} nor \emph{Caenorhabditis elegans}. Compared to Stx5S, Stx5L contains 54 extra N-terminal residues bearing an Arginine – Lysine – Arginine (RKR) ER retrieval motif, and as a result, Stx5L locates more to the ER whereas Stx5S locates more to the Golgi network\cite{linders_stx5-mediated_2019,hui_isoform_1997,dominguez_gp25l/emp24/p24_1998,miyazaki_contribution_2012,suga_syntaxin_2009}. The evolutionary necessity of the two Stx5 isoforms remains unclear but it has been suggested that Stx5L is important to maintain ER structure by binding microtubules, possibly via CLIMP-63\cite{miyazaki_contribution_2012,avci_intramembrane_2019}. In addition, immunoprecipitations showed that GosR1 and Bet1L preferentially interact with Stx5S over Stx5L\cite{hay_mammalian_1996,shestakova_interaction_2007}, suggesting that Stx5S might act in more fusogenic complexes later at the ER-Golgi interface whereas Stx5L might be more involved in earlier fusion steps.

In the present study, we identified a genetic variant in the second translation codon methionine-55, fully abrogating the production of Stx5S and providing a unique opportunity to study the physiological relevance of the existence of two isoforms in humans. Patients homozygous for this mutation have a very severe clinical phenotype associated with infantile mortality and defective protein glycosylation. We demonstrate that although Stx5L can largely compensate for the lack of Stx5S, the loss of Stx5S leads to defects in intra-Golgi trafficking with mislocalization of glycosyltransferases, which results in pronounced defects in glycosylation. Moreover, by synchronizing the intracellular trafficking of Stx5 isoforms, we reveal differential trafficking routes for either isoform and identify Stx5S as the dominant Qa-SNARE for intra-Golgi transport. This is the first time that a mutation in an alternate starting site of ribosomal translation is related to human disease. This finding reveals that protein function can be regulated at the level of translation initiation and has profound effects on intracellular membrane trafficking and Golgi function.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Clinical data}

The family history (Supplementary Figure~\ref{fig:ch6supfig1}) revealed multiple deceased individuals (IV:3, IV:9, IV:10) shortly after birth, spontaneous abortions (IV:5, IV:6, IV:7), and elective abortions in the 20th-21st week of pregnancy due to abnormal fetal ultrasound (US) (IV:4, IV:8). Fetal US of individuals IV:8, IV:9, and IV:10 (Figure~\ref{fig:ch6fig1}a-c, respectively) showed shortening of the long bones with suspicion of chondrodysplasia. Patients IV:9 and IV:10 showed highly dysmorphic facial features (high forehead, frontal bossing, prominent glabella, short and upturned nose, long philtrum, micrognathia and dysplastic ears), skeletal dysplasia (short extremities and narrow thorax), profound hypotonia, hepatomegaly, and many abnormal laboratory parameters including elevated cholesterol (Figure~\ref{fig:ch6fig1}b, c, Supplementary Table~\ref{tbl:ch6tbl1}). After birth, the main clinical problem for both patients IV:9 and IV:10 was progressive liver failure with cholestasis and hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia ( Supplementary Table~\ref{tbl:ch6tbl1}). Liver failure was the main cause of death at the age of 28 days and 8 months, in patients IV:9 and IV:10, respectively. Autopsy of fetus IV:8 revealed bilateral hydronephrosis and sacral lordosis. Autopsy of patient IV:9 showed hepatomegaly with stage 3 to 4 liver fibrosis, agenesis of left kidney, hyperemia of internal organs, ventricular septal defect and suggestive pathohistological features of chondrodysplasia. Autopsy of patient IV:10 showed biliary cirrhosis and nodular regenerative hyperplasia, pancreatic hypertrophia/hyperplasia, and narrow thorax with normal lung development.

\subsection{Abnormal protein glycosylation suggests a defect in Golgi trafficking}

Known genetic causes for skeletal dysplasias were excluded (IV:8), no submicroscopic chromosomal abnormalities were found, while most metabolic investigations were normal except for the Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDG) (IV:9 and IV:10). CDG screening revealed a strong hyposialylation of protein N-glycosylation and mucin-type O-glycosylation, as analyzed by isofocusing of respectively plasma transferrin (Figure~\ref{fig:ch6fig1}d, Supplementary Table~\ref{tbl:ch6tbl2}) and apolipoprotein CIII (ApoCIII-IEF, Figure~\ref{fig:ch6fig1}e, Supplementary Table~\ref{tbl:ch6tbl2}). ApoCIII-IEF showed a strong increase of non-sialylated apoCIII (ApoCIII-0) band intensitysities compared to the intensities of the fully glycosylated form, even stronger than observed for genetic defects in the Conserved Oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex, a known group of disorders with disturbed Golgi homeostasis and abnormal glycosylation\cite{linders_sugary_2020}.

To gain more insight into the abnormal N-glycan structures, mass spectrometry was performed of intact transferrin (Figure~\ref{fig:ch6fig1}f, g, Supplementary Figure~\ref{fig:ch6supfig2}) and of total plasma protein derived N-glycans (Figure~\ref{fig:ch6fig1}f, h, Supplementary Figure~\ref{fig:ch6supfig3}). Analysis of intact transferrin of individuals IV:9 and IV:10 revealed multiple abnormal glycan structures, divided into two categories: high mannose structures and truncated glycans. Compared to the peak height of completely glycosylated transferrin, a dominant accumulation was found of high-mannose glycans suggesting a problem with MGAT1, the enzyme that adds the next \emph{N}-acetylglucosamine during N-glycosylation. Furthermore, a series of transferrin isoforms was observed with reduced incorporation of galactose and sialic acid residues. Similar glycosylation patterns were observed in COG5-CDG\cite{fung_cog5-cdg_2012,paesold-burda_deficiency_2009,palmigiano_maldi-ms_2017,rymen_cog5-cdg_2012}. Analysis of N-glycans released from total plasma proteins recapitulated the two categories of abnormal glycans with the accumulation of high mannose glycans, as well as reduced incorporation of galactose and sialic acid residues. Together, these data indicate that the activities of multiple glycosyltransferases in the Golgi apparatus are affected, covering both N- and O-glycosylation, thereby suggesting a general disturbance in Golgi trafficking.   

\subsection{Molecular investigations result in the identification of variants in \emph{STX5}}

Chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) using HumanCytoSNP-12 microarrays revealed multiple long contiguous stretches of homozygosity (LCSH, >5 Mb) distributed across the entire genome, with several regions of homozygosity on chromosome 11 in all three affected sibs (IV:8, IV:9 and IV:10, Supplementary Table~\ref{tbl:ch6tbl5}). Exome sequencing was performed in proband IV:9 to find the genetic variant that could be associated with the disease. Only two homozygous rare protein-altering variants without homozygous individuals in the gnomAD v3 database were identified in shared homozygous stretches on chromosome 11. First, a missense variant in the VPS37C gene was discovered (NM\_017966.4:c.760G>T p.(Gly254Cys) rs201088253). However, as this variant reaches an allele frequency of 0.9\% in Estonia, it is unlikely to cause a rare genetic disorder. The second variant was identified in the \emph{STX5} gene (NM\_003164.4:c.163A>G p.(Met55Val), Figure~\ref{fig:ch6fig2}a). This is a missense mutation affecting the alternative starting codon for the production of the short Stx5 isoform. The variant is absent from the gnomAD v3 database and was thus classified as a potentially disease-causing variant. The variant was confirmed by Sanger sequencing as homozygous in all affected individuals (IV:8, IV:9, and IV:10) and as heterozygous in the mother (III:2). Paternal DNA was not available for testing.

To confirm the effect of the genetic variant on both Stx5 proteoforms, immunoblotting was performed in primary dermal fibroblasts of patients IV:9 and IV:10. While Stx5L was present, a total absence of Stx5S was found in both patient fibroblasts (Figure~\ref{fig:ch6fig2}b, c). We next tested the expression of known interaction partners of Stx5. The levels of Qc-SNARE Bet1L, which forms a complex with Stx5 upon retrograde intra-Golgi trafficking\cite{xu_gs15_2002,linders_stx5-mediated_2019,malsam_organization_2011,tai_participation_2004}, were also reduced.  In contrast (Figure~\ref{fig:ch6fig2}b, c), the expression of Qc-SNARE Bet1, which forms a complex with Stx5 upon anterograde ER-Golgi trafficking\cite{hay_localization_1998,zhang_ykt6_2001,linders_stx5-mediated_2019,zhang_mammalian_1997} was not reduced (Figure~\ref{fig:ch6fig2}b, c). Likewise, the expression of Qb-SNAREs GosR1 and GosR2, which can complex with Stx5 for anterograde ER-Golgi trafficking and retrograde intra-Golgi trafficking\cite{xu_gs15_2002,xu_subunit_2000,hay_localization_1998,zhang_ykt6_2001,linders_stx5-mediated_2019,hay_mammalian_1996} were unaltered in patient dermal fibroblast lysates. We hypothesized that a compensatory mechanism might exist by upregulating the expression of the trans-Golgi Qa-SNARE Stx16\cite{mallard_early/recycling_2002}, usually involved in endosome-to-TGN trafficking\cite{dingjan_endosomal_2018}, but we did not detect a change of Stx16 expression in patient fibroblast lysates (Figure~\ref{fig:ch6fig2}b, c). As a first step to confirm that fibroblasts offer a useful model to recapitulate the cell biological abnormalities due to loss of the Stx5S isoform, we studied glycosylation by fluorescently-labeled lectins. 

\subsection{Glycosylation defects in Stx5M55V patient fibroblasts}

Patient fibroblasts could be cultured normally and we did not observe apparent differences in growth rate or viability between healthy control and patient-derived cell lines. Cell surface staining with the lectin SNA-I from \emph{Sambucus nigra}, which binds terminal sialic acid in an $\alpha$-2,6 linkage of fully-formed N-glycan moieties and, to a lesser extent, sialic acid in an $\alpha$-2,3 linkage, showed that glycosylation was also impaired at the cellular level in patient fibroblasts. Compared to fibroblasts of healthy donors, we observed a more than two-fold reduced SNA-I labeling intensity in Stx5M55V patient fibroblasts (Figure~\ref{fig:ch6fig2}d,e). Moreover, most signal came from punctuated structures in the Stx5M55V patient fibroblasts, instead of the more uniform cell membrane labeling observed in the healthy donor fibroblasts. To confirm this glycosylation defect, we performed cell surface staining with the lectin PNA (Peanut agglutinin) from \emph{Arachis hypogaea}, which binds terminal galactose residues present on mucin O-glycan moieties of incompletely glycosylated proteins. Opposite to our findings with SNA-I, we observed an increased labeling intensity in Stx5M55V patient fibroblasts relative to healthy control by about six-fold (Figure~\ref{fig:ch6fig2}f,g). These findings show that patient-derived fibroblasts, which express Stx5L but lack Stx5S, have a glycosylation defect. 

Next, we evaluated the expression levels of Stx5S and Stx5L in lysates of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from four different healthy donors (Supplementary Figure~\ref{fig:ch6supfig4}). While total Stx5 expression levels varied strongly (more than two-fold), the ratio of Stx5S and Stx5L was approximately equimolar for all individuals, demonstrating that the expression ratio is similar in PBMCs of different healthy subjects.

To determine the role of Stx5S in Golgi transport, we generated a Stx5L-lacking fibroblast cell line from one of the prior used control lines, using CRISPR/Cas9 (Fib Stx5$\Delta$L, Supplementary Figure~\ref{fig:ch6supfig5}a). We then performed the same cell surface staining as described above. While we observed a similar decrease in SNA-I labeling intensity in Stx5$\Delta$L fibroblasts as in Stx5M55V patient fibroblasts, the staining pattern was more similar to healthy control and showed a uniform plasma membrane-localized SNA-I labeling (Supplementary Figure~\ref{fig:ch6supfig5}b-c). In addition, opposite to Stx5M55V fibroblasts, the low PNA labeling intensity was reduced further in Fib Stx5$\Delta$L (Supplementary Figure~\ref{fig:ch6supfig5}d-e). To investigate this difference further, we generated two clonal HeLa cell lines lacking Stx5L using the same method (Stx5$\Delta$L: B1A7 and C1F4, Supplementary Figure~\ref{fig:ch6supfig5}f), and we observed a decrease in the already low SNA-I labeling intensity as measured by FACS compared to the parental HeLa cells, while PNA labeling resulted in opposite changes between the two Stx5$\Delta$L lines (Supplementary Figure~\ref{fig:ch6supfig5}g-k). The difference in PNA labeling between the HeLa Stx5$\Delta$L cell lines therefore likely is attributable by clonal variation and/or off-target effects of CRISPR/Cas9. These results demonstrate that while the loss of Stx5S or Stx5L both result in N-glycosylation defects, the defect is stronger upon the loss of Stx5S, as this results in lower levels and a punctuated distribution of sialic acid moieties. Moreover, the mucin-type O-glycosylation defect seems specific to the loss of Stx5S. As these results reiterate the glycosylation defect observed on serum transferrin, total plasma N-glycans and apoCIII mucin O-glycans, patient fibroblasts are a suitable model to investigate the cell biological consequences of the complete disruption of the Stx5S isoform.

\subsection{Stx5M55V mutation results in mislocalization of glycosyltransferases}

Given that Stx5 mediates ER-Golgi trafficking\cite{xu_gs15_2002,dascher_syntaxin_1994,xu_subunit_2000,hay_localization_1998,paek_ers-24_1997,zhang_ykt6_2001,linders_stx5-mediated_2019,tai_participation_2004,hay_mammalian_1996,zhang_mammalian_1997}, we next investigated whether the glycosylation defect in Stx5M55V patient fibroblasts was caused by the mislocalization of glycosyltransferases. We performed immunofluorescence labeling of mannosyl ($\alpha$-1,3)-glycoprotein $\beta$-1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (MGAT1, also known as GnTI), which catalyzes the addition of GlcNAc to the immature man-5 N-glycan. Compared to healthy donor fibroblasts, MGAT1 colocalizes only slightly less with the \emph{cis}-Golgi marker GM130 in patient fibroblasts (Figure~\ref{fig:ch6fig3}a, b), but colocalized substantially less with the \emph{trans}-Golgi network marker TGN46 (Figure~\ref{fig:ch6fig3}c, d). In addition, alpha-mannosidase 2 (MAN2A1), which catalyzes the final hydrolytic step in the N-glycan maturation pathway after MGAT1 conversion, colocalized substantially less with both GM130 (Supplementary Figure~\ref{fig:ch6supfig6}a, b) and TGN46 in patient fibroblasts (Supplementary Figure~\ref{fig:ch6supfig6}c, d). Similarly to MGAT1, beta-galactoside alpha-2,6-sialyltransferase 1 (ST6GAL1), which catalyzes the transfer of sialic acid to galactose residues of N-glycans in an $\alpha$-2,6 linkage, colocalized less with both GM130 (Supplementary Figure~\ref{fig:ch6supfig6}e, f) and TGN46 in patient fibroblasts (Supplementary Figure~\ref{fig:ch6supfig6}g, h). Finally, \emph{N}-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2 (GALNT2), which catalyzes the initial reaction in mucin O-linked glycan synthesis, localized more to the cis-Golgi (marker Zinc finger protein-like 1 (ZFPL1)\cite{chiu_zfpl1_2008}) (Figure~\ref{fig:ch6fig3}e, f) and less to the \emph{trans}-Golgi in patient fibroblasts (Figure~\ref{fig:ch6fig3}g, h).

N = 172 (Ctrl) and 152 (Stx5M55V) cells from 2 unique individuals tested twice.}
    \label{fig:ch6fig3}
\end{figure}

To exclude the possibility that our conclusions were affected by potential mislocalization of TGN46 in the patient cells, we repeated these experiments but now co-stained for another trans-Golgi marker, the trans-Golgi coiled-coil protein p230\cite{gleeson_p230_1996} (Supplementary Figure~\ref{fig:ch6supfig7}). Indeed, we observed similar Pearson correlation coefficients for p230 as for TGN46 with MGAT1, GALNT2, MAN2A1, and ST6GAL1 (Supplementary Figure~\ref{fig:ch6supfig7}). Moreover, to confirm that the observed changes in colocalization were not due to lower expression of glycosyltransferases, we performed immunoblotting for several glycosyltransferases and could not detect consistent differences between control and Stx5M55V fibroblasts, although we noticed substantial variation in protein expression levels of some of the glycosyltransferases between the samples (Supplementary Figure~\ref{fig:ch6supfig8}), reflecting expression differences among individuals and/or fibroblast lines.

Taken together, the loss of Stx5S results in irregular localization of glycosyltransferases to the Golgi apparatus. An altered Golgi organization and mislocalization of glycosyltransferases can have a profound impact on glycosylation as shown by computational simulations\cite{jaiman_golgi_2020}. We investigated the organization of the Golgi complex in Stx5M55V fibroblasts in more detail.

\subsection{Stx5S mediates retrograde Golgi-ER and intra-Golgi trafficking}

Transmission electron microscopy showed dilation of rough ER and Golgi cisternae in the Stx5M55V patient fibroblasts (Figure~\ref{fig:ch4fig4}a-c, gallery Supplementary Figure~\ref{fig:ch6supfig9}), similar to previously observed alteration in the ultrastructure of the Golgi in several COG defects\cite{reynders_golgi_2009,climer_membrane_2018,oka_genetic_2005}. Notwithstanding these large alterations in Golgi morphology, the polarized arrangement of Golgi apparatus cisternae was still present in Stx5M55V, as observed by immunofluorescence labeling of \emph{cis}- and \emph{trans}-Golgi markers (Supplementary Figure~\ref{fig:ch6supfig10}). These results indicate that although Stx5L is sufficient to maintain normal Golgi apparatus cisterna polarization, Stx5S is required for physiological ER and Golgi ultrastructure and proper trafficking of glycosylation enzymes.

To address the role of the Stx5 isoforms in more detail, we studied the distribution of Stx5 isoforms in the Golgi network. Because Stx5L contains an RKR ER-retrieval motif in its N-terminal extension, it locates more at the ER compared to Stx5S\cite{linders_stx5-mediated_2019,hui_isoform_1997,dominguez_gp25l/emp24/p24_1998,miyazaki_contribution_2012}. In line with this, we observed a more dominant localization of Stx5L at the ER and less at various Golgi compartments in Stx5M55V fibroblasts compared to total Stx5 localization in healthy control fibroblasts (Supplementary Figure~\ref{fig:ch6supfig11}a, b, d, e, Supplementary Figure~\ref{fig:ch6supfig12}a, b, d, e). 

A notable difference was the far more diffuse staining in Stx5M55V patients of the COPI coat protein $\beta$COP (Supplementary Figure~\ref{fig:ch6supfig11}a, c) and of TGN46 (Supplementary Figure~\ref{fig:ch6supfig11}d, f). In contrast, we observed a small increase in GM130 fluorescence in Stx5M55V patients (Supplementary Figure~\ref{fig:ch6supfig12}f). Since Western blot showed that total cellular levels of $\beta$COP and GM130 were not consistently altered in Stx5M55V patients (Supplementary Figure~\ref{fig:ch6supfig11}g), the more diffuse staining of $\beta$COP is suggestive of reduced association with COPI-coated vesicles, while the higher staining intensity of GM130 suggests more association with the \emph{cis}-Golgi. In contrast, total TGN46 protein levels were somewhat reduced in patient fibroblasts (Supplementary Figure~\ref{fig:ch6supfig11}h). These findings suggest that loss of Stx5S results in reduced COPI trafficking between GM130-marked \emph{cis}- and TGN46-marked \emph{trans}-Golgi compartments. 

Using an antibody specific to Stx5L (antibody specificity validated in Supplementary Figure~\ref{fig:ch6supfig13}), we next investigated whether the loss of Stx5S affects the intracellular distribution of Stx5L. An altered cellular localization of Stx5L might imply a compensatory mechanism. Indeed, in Stx5M55V, Stx5L localizes more to the \emph{cis}-Golgi as measured by increased colocalization with GM130 (Figure~\ref{fig:ch6fig4}d, e). A slight increase in ER localization as measured by PDI colocalization was also observed (Figure~\ref{fig:ch6fig4}f, g). Taken together, the loss of Stx5S causes Stx5L to relocalize more towards the \emph{cis}-Golgi.

As COPI is involved in retrograde Golgi-ER transport\cite{glick_membrane_2009}, we investigated whether trafficking at this interface is compromised in Stx5M55V fibroblasts by using the fungal metabolite Brefeldin A (BFA), which inhibits COPI vesicle formation\cite{galea_high-content_2015}. If loss of Stx5S results in reduced retrograde Golgi-ER transport, we expect reduced relocalization of Golgi-resident proteins to ER upon BFA treatment. Indeed, redistribution of GALNT2 from the Golgi to the ER was incomplete in patient fibroblasts (Figure~\ref{fig:ch6fig5}a-c), supporting a role for Stx5S in retrograde COPI trafficking. In addition, washout of BFA caused a more rapid localization of GALNT2 to the Golgi apparatus in Stx5M55V, likely due to its incomplete redistribution to the ER (Figure~\ref{fig:ch6fig5}a, b, d, Supplementary Figure~\ref{fig:ch6supfig14}a-c). We investigated the role of Stx5L in Golgi trafficking further using temperature-synchronizable vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSVG) fused to GFP\cite{lippincott-schwartz_secretory_2000} in patient fibroblasts. At 40°C, VSVG does not fold correctly and the VSVG-GFP protein remains trapped in the ER. A temperature shift to 32oC enables the correct refolding of VSVG resulting in the synchronized release of VSVG-GFP from the ER, transit through the Golgi network, and finally delivery at the plasma membrane where it becomes accessible to antibody labeling. VSVG-EGFP appears at a Golgi-like compartment in both control and Stx5M55V fibroblasts at 30 mins after temperature shift from 40°C to 32°C (Supplementary Figure~\ref{fig:ch6supfig14}d), but after 60 mins plasma membrane localization of VSVG is strongly reduced in Stx5M55V fibroblasts (Figure~\ref{fig:ch6fig5}e-g). Taken together, these findings show that Stx5L is sufficient for anterograde trafficking until the Golgi, but the loss of Stx5S significantly impairs intra- and/or post-Golgi trafficking, likely by the decrease of Stx5S-mediated intra-Golgi trafficking.

\end{figure}

To further delineate the role of Stx5L in retrograde Golgi-ER trafficking, we performed a BFA experiment in the Stx5L-lacking HeLa cells. In these cells, BFA resulted in faster relocalization of GALNT2 to the ER compared to parental HeLa (Supplementary Figure~\ref{fig:ch6supfig15}a, b), indicating that Stx5S suffices for retrograde COPI trafficking and the expression of Stx5L counteracts this process. Further investigation of anterograde ER-Golgi trafficking in Stx5ΔL cells with H-89 washout (Supplementary Fig. 15c, d), the retention using selective hooks (RUSH) system for synchronized ER-Golgi transport\cite{boncompain_synchronization_2012} (Supplementary Figure~\ref{fig:ch6supfig15}e, f) and temperature-synchronizable VSVG\cite{lippincott-schwartz_secretory_2000} (Supplementary Figure~\ref{fig:ch6supfig15}g, h) revealed no phenotype relating to the loss of Stx5L. Thus, these data suggest Stx5L has no necessary function in ER-Golgi trafficking as Stx5S can compensate, while Stx5L can only partly compensate for the loss of Stx5S in retrograde Golgi-ER and intra-Golgi transport.

\subsection{Faster Golgi exit of Stx5L due to ER-retrieval motif}

Our results in patient fibroblasts indicate differential trafficking roles of the two Stx5 isoforms in ER-Golgi trafficking. To gain more insight in this process, we fused each Stx5 isoform to streptavidin-binding protein (SBP) and mCitrine (Stx5L-SBP-mCitrine and Stx5S-SBP-mCitrine; Stx5L-SBP-mCitrine carries the M55V mutation to suppress expression of Stx5S). Moreover, we generated a mutant form of Stx5L where the RKR ER-retrieval motif was converted to 3$\times$ alanine (AAA) (Stx5L$\Delta$ER-SBP-mCitrine)\cite{hui_isoform_1997}, to delineate the role of this motif in ER-Golgi transport. The co-expression of these constructs with ER-localized streptavidin enabled the synchronized release of the Stx5 fusion proteins from the ER using biotin, which is the so-called RUSH system\cite{boncompain_synchronization_2012} (Figure~\ref{fig:ch6fig6}a). Co-expressing each Stx5 isoform with the Golgi marker Giantin fused to mScarlet\cite{bindels_mscarlet:_2017} in HeLa cells, allowed to visualize the trafficking of Stx5-SBP-mCitrine to the Golgi following the addition of biotin (Figure~\ref{fig:ch6fig6}a, b). All three constructs were expressed at similar levels, as judged from the fluorescent intensities, and all Stx5 forms reached the Golgi with the same rate and achieved maximal Golgi localization after about 20 minutes (Figure~\ref{fig:ch6fig6}c). However, the subsequent decrease in Golgi localization, attributed to recycling to the ER or degradation of the fusion proteins, was faster for Stx5L-SBP-mCitrine than for Stx5S or Stx5L$\Delta$ER (Figure~\ref{fig:ch6fig6}c, d). Thus, the RKR ER retrieval motif of Stx5L is necessary and sufficient for the attenuated presence of Stx5L at the Golgi, supporting that the main role of Stx5S is COPI trafficking specifically at the Golgi.

\subsection{The two isoforms of Stx5 differently engage in SNARE complexes}

Since interactions of Stx5 with Bet1 and Bet1L mediate anterograde ER-Golgi transport and retrograde intra-Golgi transport, respectively\cite{banfield_snare-like_1995,parlati_topological_2000,parlati_distinct_2002,xu_gs15_2002}, we hypothesized that Stx5S would interact more strongly with Bet1L, whereas Stx5L would interact more strongly with Bet1. We set out to test this hypothesis by performing co-immunoprecipitation with our RUSH Stx5 constructs. However, we were unable to consistently resolve differences in binding to endogenous cognate Qc-SNAREs between the two Stx5 isoforms, either with or without 30 mins biotin (Supplementary Figure~\ref{fig:ch6supfig16}). A likely explanation is that interactions might occur \emph{in vitro} during the immunoprecipitation. Therefore, we developed an approach to visualize SNARE complexes based on a combination of the RUSH system\cite{boncompain_synchronization_2012}44 and our previously developed Förster resonance energy transfer-fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FRET-FLIM) approach for visualization of SNARE complexes\cite{verboogen_fluorescence_2017} (Figure~\ref{fig:ch6fig7}a). This FRET-FLIM approach employed Stx5 isoforms C-terminally fused with a donor fluorophore (mCitrine) and Bet1L C-terminally fused with an acceptor fluorophore (mCherry). The formation of a post-fusion SNARE complex results in the close proximity of the donor and an acceptor fluorophore resulting in FRET which can be measured from a decreased donor fluorescence lifetime ($\tau$). Contrary to ratiometric FRET, FRET-FLIM is not dependent on local concentration differences or excitation intensities of the donor and acceptor fluorophores, as $\tau$ is an intrinsic property of the fluorophore itself. By combining the FRET-FLIM approach with the RUSH system, we were able to control the spatial localization of Stx5 isoforms and measure interactions specifically at the ER (no biotin) or the Golgi apparatus (20 min after biotin addition). 30 minutes prior to imaging, cells were incubated with cycloheximide in culture medium to make sure background interaction from any ER-localized newly-synthesized acceptor construct was mitigated.

For the mCitrine donor-only Stx5 constructs, we measured similar lifetimes for both isoforms (Figure~\ref{fig:ch6fig7}c, Supplementary Figure~\ref{fig:ch6supfig17}a, Stx5L: 3.02 ns ± 0.004, Stx5S: 2.99 ns ± 0.007) prior to biotin addition, while these lifetimes slightly decreased following biotin addition (Figure~\ref{fig:ch6fig7}d, Supplementary Figure~\ref{fig:ch6supfig17}a, Stx5L: 2.90 ns ± 0.006, Stx5S: 2.86 ns ±0.011). We attribute this reduced lifetime to the fact that mCitrine is somewhat pH-sensitive\cite{griesbeck_reducing_2001} and the pH of the Golgi apparatus is lower than in the ER lumen\cite{casey_sensors_2010}. We then co-expressed the Stx5 isoforms with mCherry-tagged Bet1L (Bet1L-mCherry) (Figure~\ref{fig:ch6fig7}a,b). At the ER, thus before the release of Stx5 with biotin, we observed reduced lifetimes for both Stx5S and Stx5L with Bet1L-mCherry, compared to the donor-only controls (Figure~\ref{fig:ch6fig7}b, c, Stx5L: 2.82 ns ± 0.01, Stx5S: 2.79 ± 0.01), whereas the lifetimes of Stx5S and Stx5L did not significantly differ from each other. After the release in the presence of biotin, this difference between Stx5L and Stx5S became significant and lifetimes were 2.63 ns (± 0.01) for Stx5L while Stx5S dropped to 2.52 ns (± 0.03) (Figure~\ref{fig:ch6fig7}b, d). To validate that the observed effect is indeed caused by functional SNARE complex formation, we repeated this experiment with VAMP8 instead of Bet1L as the acceptor R-SNARE. VAMP8 has no role in ER-Golgi membrane fusion but rather associates with the late endosomal/lysosomal compartment\cite{dingjan_endosomal_2018,verboogen_fluorescence_2017,antonin_r-snare_2000,bajno_focal_2000,hong_snares_2005,manderson_subcompartments_2007,murray_role_2005}. We only observed minor decreases in fluorescence lifetimes for both Stx5L and Stx5S (Supplementary Figure~\ref{fig:ch6supfig17}b, c, prior to biotin Stx5L: 2.92 ns ± 0.01, Stx5S: 2.86 ± 0.02, upon biotin addition Supplementary Figure~\ref{fig:ch6supfig17}b, d, Stx5L: 2.82 ns ± 0.01, Stx5S: 2.76 ± 0.02). These FLIM results demonstrate that Stx5S interacts more strongly with Bet1L at the Golgi than Stx5L. Thus, Stx5S is the dominant Qa-SNARE for intra-Golgi trafficking.

\section{Discussion}

Since the advent of the genomic age, close to 6,000 monogenic disorders have been discovered\cite{amberger_omim.org:_2015}. While nearly all of these disorders result in a truncated, unstable and/or nonfunctional protein, e.g., due to a genetic variant in the catalytic site or protein misfolding, isoform-specific mutations are rare. Here we present the first known mutation in an alternate site of ribosomal translation leading to human disease, namely the mutation of the second starting methionine of Stx5. This mutation leads to the complete and specific loss of Stx5S. Although \emph{STX5} is an essential gene for embryonic development in mice\cite{dickinson_high-throughput_2016,koscielny_international_2014}, here we show that in humans the loss of Stx5S still allowed a completed pregnancy. Nevertheless, patients have a very severe clinical pathology characterized by infantile mortality due to liver disease, skeletal abnormalities and protein glycosylation defects. While the exact mechanism for alternative translation is unclear, this might be an actively regulated process. It could also be simply regulated by the affinity of the ribosome for the nucleotide sequence upstream of the starting codon. Supporting the latter option, analysis of translation initiation sites with NetStart\cite{pedersen_neural_1997} revealed that the starting codon of Stx5S is located in a more optimal nucleotide context than the starting codon for Stx5L (Supplementary Figure~\ref{fig:ch6supfig18}). This could lead to more leaky ribosomal scanning\cite{kochetov_alternative_2008,kozak_regulation_2005}, resulting in the more or less equimolar ratio of expression of Stx5L and Stx5S that we observed in fibroblasts and PBMCs of healthy individuals. On the other hand, Western blot revealed different ratios of the two Stx5 isoforms in different organs in rats\cite{hui_isoform_1997}, suggesting (i) that different cell types express different levels of Stx5S and Stx5L and this is probably related to their exocytic function, and (ii) that the initiation of starting translation might be regulated and not merely dependent on the binding affinities of the ribosome. 

Cofractionation and microscopy studies have revealed that the localization of Stx5L and Stx5S overlap to a large extent, but that they are generally distributed as a gradient between ER, ERGIC, and Golgi apparatus\cite{dominguez_gp25l/emp24/p24_1998}. This observation has previously led to the suggestion that Stx5L might play a role in early Golgi trafficking, while Stx5S functions in late Golgi trafficking\cite{xu_gs15_2002,dascher_syntaxin_1994,xu_subunit_2000,hay_localization_1998,paek_ers-24_1997,zhang_ykt6_2001,linders_stx5-mediated_2019,tai_participation_2004,hay_mammalian_1996,zhang_mammalian_1997}. Our data now shows that this is not the case and that both Stx5 isoforms can mediate both early and late anterograde and retrograde Golgi trafficking with sufficient fidelity to keep the layered Golgi morphology intact. However, the role of Stx5S is more important for retrograde Golgi-ER and intra-Golgi trafficking, and its absence leads to an altered ER and Golgi morphology, distribution of glycosylation enzymes and trafficking proteins. The cumulative effect of slight mislocalization of all glycosyltransferases might well explain the observed hypoglycosylation in the Stx5M55V patients. Indeed, recent modeling showed that the slight mislocalization of glycosyltransferases can result in large differences in glycosylation patterns, because glycosylation is the result of the sequential addition and removal of different sugar moieties at the various Golgi compartments\cite{jaiman_algorithmic_2018}.

The dominant role of Stx5S in retrograde Golgi-ER and intra-Golgi trafficking is corroborated by the observation that cellular levels of Bet1L, with known roles in intra-Golgi trafficking, are lower in Stx5M55V patient cells. Interestingly, genetic variants in conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) tethering complex components, which are also implicated in CDGs, also resulted in lower levels of Bet1L as well and this was attributed to a mislocalization of Bet1L to the ER where it was degraded\cite{oka_cog_2004}. Possibly, a similar mechanism might explain the reduction in Bet1L levels in Stx5M55V patients. Although the Stx5-Bet1L interaction has been reported in several studies\cite{malsam_organization_2011,glick_membrane_2009}, our study now shows this interaction \emph{in situ} using FLIM. This interaction is localization dependent and occurs mostly when Stx5 is localized at the Golgi. Moreover, we observed stronger interaction of Bet1L with Stx5S compared to Stx5L at the Golgi, which is likely the result of the differential localization of both isoforms.

An important function of the Golgi apparatus is protein glycosylation\cite{ohtsubo_glycosylation_2006}. Collectively, somatic mutations affecting glycosylation are classified as CDGs and currently over 100 monogenic diseases affecting glycosylation have been identified\cite{freeze_solving_2014,fisher_bridging_2016}. A significant number of these include defects in Golgi trafficking, such as the components of the conserved oligomeric Golgi tethering complex (COG)\cite{reynders_golgi_2009,blackburn_more_2018,foulquier_conserved_2006,foulquier_new_2007,kranz_cog8_2007,miller_recognition_2012,morava_common_2007,ng_molecular_2007,wu_mutation_2004}, mutations in genes coding for the vacuolar H\textsuperscript{+}-ATPase and its assembly factors\cite{hucthagowder_loss--function_2009,jansen_ccdc115_2016,jansen_tmem199_2016,jansen_atp6ap1_2016}, and novel genes involved in Golgi ion homeostasis\cite{foulquier_tmem165_2012,ashikov_integrating_2018,park_slc39a8_2015}. Furthermore, defects are known in components associated with COPI-coated vesicles\cite{witkos_gorab_2019} that result in deficient protein glycosylation in patient cells, but are not linked to abnormal glycosylation of proteins in plasma and thus escape routine CDG screening. Our study is the first example of an ER-Golgi SNARE being implicated in CDG, thus highlighting the potential of glycosylation screening in patients to uncover novel cell biological mechanisms.

While the cellular effects of the loss of Stx5S in Stx5M55V mutant fibroblasts are subtle, there can be pronounced consequences in secretory cells, such as exocrine and endocrine cells, which are sensitive to minor disruptions of the secretory pathway\cite{ohtsubo_glycosylation_2006,witkos_gorab_2019,zhong_golgi_2011,zhao_membrane_2012}. Not only can the defects in intra-Golgi trafficking explain the hypoglycosylation in Stx5M55V patients, but also of other pathologies. For instance, Stx5 can participate in the trafficking and processing of the very low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDL-R) and this role is heavily dependent on the expression of Stx5\cite{wagner_stx5_2013}, thus providing an explanation for the observed cholesterol homeostasis defect with elevated cholesterol in all Stx5M55V patients.

In summary, we have demonstrated that a mutation in an alternative translation start site in Stx5 has a severe impact on intracellular membrane trafficking, leading to the discovery of a novel CDG. While there are many previous descriptions of alternative start site variations leading to disease\cite{bogaert_n-terminal_2020}, this is the first known mutation in an alternative starting codon leading to human disease by the loss of an isoform.

The study was approved by Research Ethics Committee of the University of Tartu (approval dates 19.12.2011, 20.02.2012 and 17.03.2014, and approval numbers 210/M-17, 212/M-31 and 235/M-13, 17.03.2014, respectively) and were strictly in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent for carrying out research was obtained from the family of investigated individuals. Buffy coats and whole blood were obtained as anonymous coded specimens from the Dutch blood bank (Sanquin) and were handled according to known practice and legal guidelines. The research with human blood samples at the Department of Tumor Immunology complies with all institutional and national ethics regulations and has been approved by the ethics committee of Sanquin.

\subsection{Glycosylation studies}

Screening for CDG was carried out as described before\cite{jansen_ccdc115_2016}. Plasma N-glycan profiling was performed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry of permethylated glycans\cite{morelle_analysis_2007}, using 10 $\mu$L of plasma. High resolution mass spectrometry of intact transferrin was performed on a 6540 nanochip QTOF (Agilent), according to published protocols\cite{van_scherpenzeel_high-resolution_2015}.

\subsection{Microarray analysis}

DNA was extracted either from peripheral blood according to the standard salting out protocol (IV:9 and IV-:10) or from amnionic fluid cell culture (IV:8). Screening for chromosomal abnormalities was performed using HumanCytoSNP-12 BeadChips (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). 200 ng of total DNA per sample was processed according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. Genotypes were called by GenomeStudio v2011.1 software and the data were analyzed using GenomeStudio Genome Viewer tool (Illumina Inc.). The minimum threshold for LCSH (long contiguous stretches of homozygosity) regions was set at 5 Mb.

\subsection{Exome sequencing}

Genomic DNA was extracted from fibroblasts from patient IV:9 according to the manufacturer’s protocol using a Qiagen Mini Kit (Qiagen) and was checked for DNA degradation on agarose gels. Next generation sequencing (NGS) and analysis were performed as described\cite{jansen_tmem199_2016}. In brief, exome enrichment was performed using the SureSelect Human All Exon 50 Mb Kit (Agilent), covering $\approx$21,000 genes. The exome library was sequenced on a SOLiD 5500xl sequencer (Life Technologies). Color space reads were iteratively mapped to the hg19 reference genome with the SOLiD LifeScope software version 2.1. Called variants and indels were annotated using an in-house annotation pipeline\cite{vissers_novo_2010,nikopoulos_next-generation_2010} and common variants were filtered out based on a frequency of >0.5\% in dbSNP and a frequency of >0.3\% in our in-house database of >5,000 exomes. Quality criteria were applied to filter out variants with less than 5 variant reads and less than 20\% variation. Furthermore, synonymous variants, deep intronic, intergenic and UTR variants were excluded. The identified variant was confirmed by Sanger sequencing in all affected individuals (IV:8, IV:9, and IV:10) and their mother (III:2). Paternal DNA (III:1) was not available.

\subsection{Cell culture}

HeLa cells (authenticated by ATCC through their human STR profiling cell authentication service), including Stx5$\Delta$L cell lines, were maintained in high glucose DMEM with Glutamax (Gibco 31966021). Human primary dermal fibroblasts were obtained from patients or healthy donors and maintained in Medium 199 with EBSS and L-glutamine (Lonza BE12-119F). All media were supplemented with 10\% fetal calf serum (FCS, Greiner Bio-one, Kremsmünster, Austria) and antibiotic-antimycotic solution (Gibco 15240-062). All cells were regularly tested for mycoplasma contamination. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from buffy coats as previously described\cite{jolanda_phenotypical_2005}.

\subsection{Plasmids and transfection}

Str-KDEL\_ManII-SBP-EGFP was a gift from Franck Perez (Addgene plasmid \#65252). VAMP8-mCherry was constructed earlier\cite{verboogen_fluorescence_2017} and previously deposited to Addgene (Addgene plasmid \#92424). Str-KDEL\_Stx5L-SBP-mCitrine and Str-KDEL\_Stx5S-SBP-mCitrine were constructed by replacing the ManII-SBP-EGFP cassette in Str-KDEL\_ManII-SBP-EGFP using the AscI and XbaI restriction sites. Stx5 coding sequences were codon-optimized for Homo sapiens using JCat and ordered from Genscript, the Stx5L coding sequence carries the M55V mutation to suppress production of Stx5S. Stx5L$\Delta$ER coding sequence was generated with Q5-polymerase site-directed mutagenesis, using the Stx5L cDNA as a template with the following primer: 5’- CTTCG AATTC AATGA TTCCG GCCGC CGCCT ACGGC AGCAA GAACA CC. Sequences were verified with Sanger sequencing. HeLa cells were transfected with plasmid vectors using Fugene HD (Promega E2311), using the recommended protocol of the manufacturer. Only cells expressing low to moderate levels of the transfected plasmids, based on fluorescence intensity and manual localization scoring, were chosen for subsequent microscopic analyses.

\subsection{CRISPR/Cas9}

Stable knock out of Stx5L in fibroblasts and HeLa cells was obtained using the CRISPR-CAS9 method. For this, pairs of gRNA sequences were designed upstream of the \emph{STX5} initiation codon (crispr.mit.edu, pair 1: ATAAC CTCGG ACTGT TGTGG AGG and ATGAT CCCGC GGAAA CGCTA CGG; pair 2: TAACC TCGGA CTGTT GTGGA GGG and TGATC CCGCG GAAAC GCTAC GGG). The gRNA sequences were cloned in pSpCas9n(BB)-2A-Puro (PX462) V2.0 (gift from Feng Zhang, Addgene no. 62987)\cite{ran_genome_2013} and transfected into fibroblasts or HeLa cells by electroporation (Neon Transfection System, Thermofisher, MA). After initial selection with puromycin, the medium was changed for conditioned medium (collected from parental fibroblasts or wildtype HeLa cells at 70\% confluency) supplemented 1:1 with fresh medium. Single clones were obtained and screened for knockout of Stx5L by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting.

\subsection{Immunofluorescence}

Cells were plated on cleaned 12 mm glass coverslips (Electron Microscopy Services, 72230-01) and the following day fixed with 4\% paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes at room temperature. Following quenching with 50 mM NH\textsubscript{4}Cl in PBS, cells were permeabilized and blocked in 2\% normal donkey serum (Rockland, 017-000-121) and 0.1\% saponin (permeabilization buffer) for 30 mins at RT. Primary and secondary antibodies (list of antibodies and dilutions in Table~\ref{tbl:ch6tbl6}) were diluted in permeabilization buffer and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Finally, cells were washed with 0.1\% Triton X-100 in PBS to remove background staining and mounted with mounting medium containing 0.01\% Trolox (6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid) and 68\% glycerol in 200 mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.5 with 0.1 $\mu$g/ml DAPI. Coverslips were sealed with nail polish. Cells were imaged on a Leica SP8 SMD confocal laser scanning microscope, equipped with an HC PL APO CS2 63$\times$/1.20 WATER objective. Colocalization analysis was performed using the \emph{pearsonr} function from the Python package SciPy\cite{virtanen_scipy_2020}. Briefly, individual cells were saved to separate .tiff files with ImageJ without any modifications, and then processed in a fully automated and unbiased fashion using the \emph{pearsonr} function.

\subsection{Lectin stainings}

Cells were plated on cleaned 12 mm glass coverslips for microscopy or 6-wells plates for flow cytometry and after 72 hours culturing fixed with 4\% paraformaldehyde. Cells were blocked with Carbo-Free Blocking solution (Vector Laboratories, SP-5040) and incubated with 4 $\mu$g/mL biotinylated SNA-I (Vector Laboratories, B-1305) or PNA (Vector Laboratories, B-1075) diluted in Carbo-Free Blocking solution. Cells were then incubated with Streptavidin-Alexa Fluor 647 (ThermoScientific, S32357) before coverslips were mounted as described above. Cells were imaged on a Leica SP8 SMD confocal laser scanning microscope, equipped with an HC PL APO CS2 63$\times$/1.20 WATER objective. For flow cytometry, cells were resuspended in FACS buffer (phosphate buffered saline + 0.5\% FBS + 0.01\% NaN\textsubscript{3}). Flow cytometry samples were run on a FACSLyric flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analyzed with FlowJo X (FlowJo, LLC).

\subsection{Brefeldin A assay}

Fibroblasts were plated on 12 mm coverslips and cultured until 80\% confluent. Cells were either treated with 10 $\mu$g/mL Brefeldin A in DMSO (Cayman Chemicals, 11861) or DMSO alone for 6 minutes in a humified incubator. Washout was performed by washing five times with Leibovitz’s L-15 (Gibco 21083027) with 10\% FBS, then incubating in Leibovitz’s L-15 with 10\% FBS at 37°C for the indicated times. After incubation, plates were transferred immediately to ice and cells were fixed with 4\% paraformaldehyde, after which the above immunofluorescence protocol was performed. Microscopy images were acquired using a a Leica SP8 SMD confocal laser scanning microscope, equipped with an HC PL APO CS2 63$\times$/1.20 WATER objective. HeLa cells were plated on 12 mm coverslips and incubated in the same way with Brefeldin A, but fixed with 100\% methanol at -20°C for 15 mins. Imaging of these samples was performed using a Leica DMI6000B epifluorescence microscope equipped with an HC PL APO 63x1.40 OIL objective. Cells were analyzed using Fiji (http://fiji.sc/) by first removing noise outliers (bright outliers, radius 2.0 pixels, threshold 50), then manually selecting cells and measuring the maximum fluorescence intensity in these ROIs. Data were normalized to the mean of the DMSO control of each group.

\subsection{H-89 assay}

HeLa cells were plated on 12 mm coverslips and incubated the following day for 30 mins with 100 $\mu$M H-89 (Cayman Chemicals, 10010556) in DMSO or DMSO alone (vehicle) and H-89 was washed out with fresh medium for 5 mins. Cells were fixed with 4\% paraformaldehyde for 15 mins at RT and permeabilized with 100\% methanol at -20°C for 15 mins prior to immunostaining with ERGIC53 mouse monoclonal antibody (G1/93 or OTI1A8) before epifluorescence imaging as described for the BFA assay. Cells were analyzed using Fiji and the number of ERGIC53-positive spots was quantified with the Spot Counter plugin. Data were normalized to the mean fluorescence of the DMSO control of each group. Data was analyzed with a Mann-Whitney U non-parametric test. 

\subsection{Transmission electron microscopy}

Fibroblasts were grown in 12-wells plates and fixed with 2\% glutaraldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich, G5882) in PB (0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) for 60 mins at room temperature. Subsequently, cells were washed four times with PB and post-fixed with 1\% osmium tetroxide and 1\% potassium ferrocyanide in PB for 60 mins at room temperature. Then, cells were again washed four times with PB and four times with water. Cells were incubated overnight in 0.5\% uranyl acetate and dehydrated with graded steps of ethanol (30\%, 50\%, 70\%, 96\%, 100\%) and embedded in Epon resin. 70 nm sections were stained with 2\% uranyl acetate solution and lead citrate solution. Stained sections were then examined using a CM12 transmission electron microscope (Phillips).

\subsection{Live-cell epifluorescence microscopy}

Cells were seeded in four-compartment dishes (Greiner 627870) and transfected as described above (3:1 weight ratio reporter construct:Golgi label). Before imaging, the culture medium was exchanged for Leibovitz’s L-15 (Gibco 21083027). Samples were imaged using a DMI6000B (Leica Microsystems) with a heated stage (Pecon) and objective heater. All samples were imaged using an HC PL APO 63$\times$/1.40–0.60 OIL objective. VSVG-ts045-EGFP experiments were performed at 32°C after overnight incubation at 40°C, while all other epifluorescence experiments were performed at 37°C. For RUSH experiments, an equal amount of Leibovitz’s L-15 supplemented with biotin was added to the well immediately before imaging, to reach a final concentration of 40 $\mu$M biotin. Live cell imaging was started immediately with 15 sec or 30 sec frame rates. Analysis was performed with Fiji, after registration of the image stacks, the increase in fluorescence was measured in the Golgi area by using the thresholded mScarlet-Giantin signal as an image mask.

\subsection{FRET-FLIM}

All imaging took place in Leibovitz’s L-15 supplemented with 10 $\mu$g/mL cycloheximide (Sigma-Aldrich, C4859) and cells were pulsed with biotin as described above. Imaging was performed on a Leica SP8 SMD system at 37°C, equipped with an HC PL APO CS2 63$\times$/1.20 WATER objective. Fluorophores were excited with a pulsed white light laser, operating at 80 MHz. mCitrine was excited at 514 nm, two separate HyD detectors were used to collect photons, set at 521-565 nm and 613-668 nm respectively. Photons were collected for one minute and lifetime histograms of the donor fluorophore were fitted with monoexponential decay functions convoluted with the microscope instrument response function in Leica LAS X.

\subsection{Immunoprecipitation}

HeLa cells were lysed 48 hours post-transfection with IP lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 137 mM NaCl, 1\% IGEPAL, 2 mM EDTA and complete protease inhibitors (Roche 5892791001)). Protein levels were equilibrated and lysates were immunoprecipitated with 1 $\mu$g anti-GFP-antibody (Rockland 600-401-215) and protein A beads (ThermoFisher, 20333) for 1 hour at 4°C with constant agitation. After three washes with IP lysis buffer, samples were boiled in 5x SDS sample buffer with $\beta$-mercaptoethanol and resolved with SDS-PAGE and subsequent immunoblotting.

\subsection{SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting}

Cells were plated in 12-wells plates in culture medium and lysed the following day with SDS lysis buffer (1\% SDS, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8). Lysates were diluted to equal protein content (30 $\mu$g per lane) with SDS lysis buffer, separated with SDS-PAGE on 4–20\% Mini-PROTEAN TGX Precast Protein Gels (Biorad, 4561094) and subsequently transferred onto 0.45 $\mu$m PVDF membranes. Small molecular weight proteins (Bet1 and Bet1L) were separated on 16\% Schaegger gels\cite{schagger_tricinesds-page_2006}.

\subsection{Quantification and statistical analysis}

All mean values represent the average of all cells analyzed. All comparisons between two groups were first checked for similar mean and median values and acceptable (< 3x) difference in variance, before statistical analysis with an unpaired two-sided Student’s t-test. Relative intensity data was first transformed using the binary logarithm before analysis with an unpaired two-sided Student’s t-test. H-89 data was analyzed with a Mann-Whitney U non-parametric test. Stx5 kinetics data were analyzed with a one-way ANOVA, followed by a post-hoc Tukey’s honestly significant difference test. Stx5 FLIM data were analyzed with a two-way ANOVA, with the isoform and timepoint as independent variables, followed by a post-hoc Tukey’s honestly significant difference test. p < 0.05 was considered significant. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p ≤ 0.0001. All statistical analyses were performed using R statistical software. All numerical data were visualized using R package \emph{ggplot2}\cite{wickham_ggplot2:_2016}, with violins representing the overall distribution of the data and means ± 95\% CI overlaid. 

\subsection{Data and code availability}

H-89 inhibits export of cargo from ER exit sites via inhibition of protein kinase A, and causes redistribution of ERGIC53 to the ER, both of which are restored upon washout\cite{aridor_kinase_2000,nakagawa_sar1_2012}. Representative epifluorescence micrographs. Scalebars, 10 $\mu$m. DAPI in blue. \textbf{(d)} The relative number of ERGIC53 punctae of panel (a). All data were normalized to the average of the DMSO condition of each of the lines. N = 140 (WT DMSO), 90 (WT H-89), 92 (WT Washout), 169 (Stx5$\Delta$L), 188 (Stx5$\Delta$L H-89) and 167 (Stx5$\Delta$L Washout) cells from 2 independent  experiments. \textbf{(e)} Trafficking of ManII-SBP-EGFP in parental HeLa (WT, green) or HeLa Stx5$\Delta$L (Stx5$\Delta$L, blue) over time (n $\approx$40 cells/condition). As part of the RUSH system\cite{boncompain_synchronization_2012}, ManII-SBP-EGFP is held at the ER in absence of biotin by interaction with a streptavidin-KDEL hook protein. After addition of biotin at t = 0, ManII-SBP-EGFP can exit the ER normally and traffic to the Golgi. ManII-SBP-EGFP intensity at the Golgi was measured, corrected to the total cellular intensity of ManII-SBP-EGFP per frame, and normalized to t = 0. SBP, streptavidin binding protein. \textbf{(f)} Quantification of slope coefficients from panel (c) of the linear section (3-6 min). No differences between WT and Stx5$\Delta$L were observed. N = 38 (WT) and 79 (Stx5$\Delta$L) cells from 2 independent experiments. \textbf{(g)} Trafficking of VSVG-ts045-EGFP in parental HeLa (WT, green) or HeLa Stx5$\Delta$L (Stx5$\Delta$L, blue) over time after shift to 32°C (n $\approx$40 cells/condition). When cells expressing VSVG-ts045-EGFP are cultured at 40°C, the tagged protein misfolds and is retained at the ER. Shifting the cells to 32°C at t = 0 refolds the protein and enables it to exit the ER normally and traffic to the Golgi\cite{lippincott-schwartz_secretory_2000}. VSVG-ts045-EGFP intensity at the Golgi was measured, corrected to the total cellular intensity of VSVG-ts045-EGFP per frame, and normalized to t = 0. \textbf{(h)} Quantification of slope coefficients from panel (e) of the linear section (3-15 min). No differences between WT and Stx5$\Delta$L were observed. N = 51 (WT) and 103 (Stx5$\Delta$L) cells from 2 independent experiments.}
